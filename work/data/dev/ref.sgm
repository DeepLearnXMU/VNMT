</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The star-crossed marriage between Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and US marine Johnson was once extensively feted on US television. However, it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after only five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Meriam is a member of the Gulf country Bahrain's royal family. Johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair, Their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that after only five years, the couple is headed to the court after Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The pair met in 1999 when career military man Johnson was stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> But his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Their union was forbidden by the royal family, so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap, forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After a bitter immigration battle with US authorities, the couple finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the famed and glitzy Las Vegas Strip when Johnson was 23 and the bride only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the "Sin City" of Las Vegas, the constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while Meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city, frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband. </seg>

<seg id=1> This Week's Eurozone Economic Indicators to Show Continuous Economic Weakening in Europe </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Economists said that Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data is expected to show a pick-up in industrial activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next, but the longer-term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The most important economic indicators of the week will be in Germany, where the ZEW institute's economic expectations index, which is due on the 7th and is closely watched by the market, will offer Europe its first evidence of economic confidence in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index fell sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Economists said the significant appreciation of the Euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey, so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "Given that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the Euro's appreciation, uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in Germany, have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely," BNP's economists said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news subsidiary, the index will drop again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Teather of UBS investment bank said Germany's ZEW economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> "Expectations of future German economic activity, as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants, will continue to fall in our view," said Teather. </seg>

<seg id=1> Ukraine Crisis Causing Tensions between East and West to Dominate OSCE Meeting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Russia has been accusing the West of interfering in the affairs of Eastern Europe, which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in Ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which will open tomorrow. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=3> Russia is irritated by the creeping influence of the West into corners of Europe it previously considered its backyard, like the Baltic states, Georgia and central Asia.

</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Ukraine's Supreme Court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re-voting of the recent second-round presidential election. And before this, the European Union had called on member states of the OSCE to ask their observers to get ready for "the quickest and efficient actions". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to European sources, the number of OSCE observers will increase to 1,000 from the original 600 in Ukraine's re-election scheduled for December 26th. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bush's Major Test: Intelligence Reform Bill to Face Congressional Vote this Week </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The intelligence reform bill the US congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second-term agenda pushed by Republican President Bush, whose support level among Republican congressmen will be his first major test after re-election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In a newspaper interview yesterday, Kean, the Republican who led the investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the Congress and that the matter itself augurs ill for bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "Congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and Congress can't get these big issues taken care of, and then we're all in trouble," Kean said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "It'll be a long time before there's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80% of the American people in the polls," he told The New York Daily News. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=6> Several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of America's antiquated spy network by months, years or kill it altogether. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Ukraine's pro-West opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing Ukrainian President Kuchma before the second round presidential re-election. </seg>
<seg id=3> The constitutional reform will dilute most of the president's powers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> With the November 21st vote declared invalid by the Supreme Court because of massive vote fraud in the second-round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the Central Election Commission for December 26, opposition leader Yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with Kuchma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form, all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament. This would be unacceptable," said Timoshenko, an ally of Yushchenko. </seg>

<seg id=1> Ukraine's Political Crisis Enters Third Week with Opposition Calling for Continuous Protest </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The chaos caused by Ukraine's presidential election has entered its third week. Opposition leader Yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing President Kuchma dismisses Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital of Kiev for two weeks, blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by Soviet experts to hold military parades. The people power they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of presidential election of December 21st and the Central Election Commission to order a reelection for December 26th. The parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych, but Kuchma, Yanukovych's mentor, has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital's Independence Square this evening that Kuchma should dismiss his government, and reshuffle the Central Election Commission. In addition, both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Before these decisions are made, the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed," he said, starting his campaign for the December 26 election. </seg>
<seg id=6> "Over the past 14 days, the square has shown the love for Ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their own choice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "We are undergoing a fight between good and evil. The world is applauding our victory and is proud of Ukraine," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> As the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by Moscow and Yushchenko and Kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform, Polish President Kwasniewski, Lithuanian President Adamkus and Russian envoy Gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Quoting "high-level" Egyptian sources, Egypt's state news agency, the Middle East News Agency (MENA), said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=5> "An important understanding has been reached by Egypt, Israel, the Palestinians and the significant international parties, such as the United States and the European Union, agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," MENA said. </seg>

<seg id=6> Following the death last month of veteran Palestinian leader Arafat, the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final Middle East peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine. </seg>

<seg id=7> MENA said officials expect that "preparations would take place until July, after which political action will begin". </seg>

<seg id=1> One Billion Children Suffer from War, Poverty and AIDS </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from poverty, war and the scourge of AIDS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> UNICEF says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are regularly imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in London that "when half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood," Bellamy added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> UNICEF has joined hands with researchers from Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter, 400 million have no access to safe water, 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million (mostly girls) have never been to school in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of "severe deprivation", which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities. </seg>

<seg id=1> EU Resists Chinese Pressure to Lift Arms Embargo </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The European Union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on China from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, but said it was working towards lifting the 15-year-old ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The EU Dutch presidency made the remarks following a China-EU summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands says it cannot speculate how the EU will end the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The EU imposed the arms ban on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although the arms embargo overshadowed the China-EU summit, the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the EU claim that such deals have strengthened their "strategic partnership". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "The EU side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo," said the EU in a joint statement made after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The statement points out that the Chinese delegation "welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao didn't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit. He said the ban "does not reflect the partnership between China and the EU". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between China and the EU," Wen Jiabao said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> A group of EU countries led by France is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted, saying the ban is outdated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> But some in the EU worry that without a strengthened set of EU rules, a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve China's military strength. </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Research Finds Folic Acid May Be Linked to Breast Cancer But Link Not Confirmed </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A new health study points out that folic acid, a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects, has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> But the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid, found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables, is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate, or a placebo, mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The study published in the British Medical Journal says that by September 2002, breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five-milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> One of the researchers, Ness, has stressed the results were merely "preliminary¡­ intended to point the way towards further research". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "It's entirely possible that this is a chance finding, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements. </seg>
<seg id=10> He says there is a "considerable difference between the trial" and current dosage recommendations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4-microgram daily supplement of folic acid ¨C more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study. </seg>

<seg id=1> Japan's Economic Growth Likely to Slow Down Next Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Japan's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> While huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to Japan this year after a decade of stagnation, analysts now pin their hopes on a booming China to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The evidence is mounting that Japan's economy could slump briefly in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Under a recently adopted new data methodology, Japan's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1% in the July-September quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At present, economists still differ in their views about the robustness of Japan's economic recovery. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> According to estimates by BNP Paribas researchers, Japan's economy will record a 2.3% growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in March next year and the fiscal year that follows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They call 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the US economy is firmly on a recovery track and Japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Another relatively pessimistic view is from UFJ Institute economists who expect only 1.8% growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6% for the following fiscal year. </seg>
<seg id=10> They have cited the "potential risk" that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes. </seg>

<seg id=1> French Foreign Minister: Middle East Peace Process to Test French-US Ties </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> After a meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today, French Foreign Minister Barnier said that resuming Middle East peace talks would be a "test" of their trans-Atlantic relationship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Following the death of Palestinian leader Arafat, France called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between Barnier and Powell after their meeting. </seg>

<seg id=4> Barnier flew into Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor, National Security Adviser Rice, before turning around and heading to Brussels for a European Union summit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Both Paris and Washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the US invasion of Iraq last year, but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the Middle East impasse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "We want to improve future relations between France and America and Europe and America," said Barnier, after a short meeting with US Secretary of State Powell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the Middle East to take advantage of what he termed a "window of opportunity" created after Arafat's death last month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Powell has not made any promise. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said the two had spoken of a British plan to hold a meeting bringing in the Palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> US officials say they have made it their priority to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace to ensure smooth Palestinian elections next month. </seg>
<seg id=12> The election will produce a leader who could rein in Islamic militants and resume talks with Israel. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japan's Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) as early as January next year. </seg>
<seg id=3> Jiji Press reports that during a meeting with the South Korean Foreign and Commercial Minister, Ban Ki-Moon, in the southern Japanese city of Ibusuki in Kagoshima county, Machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible, since both Tokyo and Seoul wish to conclude the FTA by the end of 2005. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident he will win a second four-year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With national elections slated for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in Thailand. The bird flu swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand, where the government admitted it had "made mistakes" in its handling of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, the health concern is unlikely to unseat Thaksin. Instead, many are asking only how thorough his victory will be, and what will it mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "The phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at Thaksin, he has managed to capture popularity for the time being," Kraisak, Chairman of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs told the AFP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "But things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and associates), the social injustices and the violence," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is because of social injustices and violence that chaos erupted in Thailand's Muslim-majority deep south, where a sporadic separatist insurgency occurred continuously starting in January. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=2> Late Palestinian leader Arafat's Cabinet Secretary Abdelrahman reveals that Arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago. It was on September 25, 2003," Abdelrahman told Al-Hayat newspaper. </seg>
<seg id=4> "The president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit. </seg>
<seg id=5> It was from that moment that the president's health started slowly deteriorating." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11. </seg>
<seg id=7> Some senior Palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, French doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Two weeks before the delegation's call on Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove Arafat, although without specifying by what means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The Israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for Arafat, who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters. </seg>

<seg id=2> US President Bush admitted today that the Iraqi army was not ready to replace US troops, and warned that the election scheduled to be held on January 30th next year would not be an end to serious violence in Iraq. </seg>

<seg id=2> US Secretary of State Colin Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the Iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster Iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between Iraqi and Iranian Shias. </seg>

<seg id=3> There are growing indications that Sunni Arabs will either boycott the January 30th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the Iraqi authority due to a spreading insurgency. </seg>

<seg id=1> Japanese Defense Chief: Never Forget Militaristic History, Respect Neighboring Nations' Dignity </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Director General of Japan's Defense Agency, Yoshinori Ono, said today that even with Japan's high profile in the world, it would not forget its militarist history and would keep in mind neighboring Asian countries' "dignity". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Asked about concerns likely to rise upon Japan sending its Self Defense Forces (SDF) to the tsunami-hit areas of South Asia, Ono said, "When we have contacts with Southeast Asian countries, we should never forget the past." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He told reporters, "We must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly. </seg>
<seg id=5> When looking back at the past, we should fully respect other countries' dignity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Ono specifically talked about this year as marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. "We hope we can be reborn and cooperate with the new era," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ono has just concluded a tour of several tsunami-hit South Asian countries. He said that when the Indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by Japan's SDF should come to an end no later than the end of March, he felt the "dignity" of an independent nation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The UN has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the Indonesian government. </seg>
<seg id=9> Foreign troops have been widely praised for offering aid to the most remote tsunami survivors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 1,000 Japanese SDF soldiers are heading to countries that were hit by the tsunami on December 26th. The death toll of the disaster has exceeded 163,000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> This is the largest deployment operation of Japan's SDF since the end of the Second World War. </seg>

<seg id=1> Political Interference in NHK Program? War of Words Erupts in Japanese Media </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Allegations that the public-owned Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft-pedal a program on Japan's legacy of sexual enslavement during World War II have pitted liberal Japanese media against their conservative counterparts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Liberal Japanese media have attacked NHK for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But conservative newspapers have defended NHK's editing of the program, saying that NHK executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the Japanese military during the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during Japan's occupation of Asian nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly Korean but also from Taiwan, China, the Philippines and Indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese army brothels during the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The program's chief producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior NHK officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa, who expressed concerns over the program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nagai said top NHK officials then re-edited and shortened the program. </seg>
<seg id=10> "NHK bowed to political pressure," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be "fair" but strongly denied pressuring the broadcaster. </seg>

<seg id=2> Economists said today that Eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control. </seg>
<seg id=3> Meanwhile, Eurozone industrial output and French consumer spending are both expected to decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When the European Union's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20th this month, they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3% in December from 2.2% in November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> But the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases, and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%. </seg>
<seg id=6> Core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Economists point out that core inflation, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol prices, has remained at a 1.6-2% range for the past two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> European Central Bank President Trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently. </seg>
<seg id=9> While inflation will remain above 2% in the coming months, it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Meanwhile, another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the Eurozone's November industrial output on the 18th, given recent evidence of weak growth in Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> German output declined 1.7% in November and economists polled by AFP's financial news subsidiary AFX News expect Eurozone output to fall 0.4% in November following the 0.5% drop recorded in October. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Information Center has cited Zhao Ziyang's family members as saying Zeng Qinghong visited him at 6:00am in a Beijing hospital, about one hour before he died at the age of 85. </seg>

<seg id=5> The Information Center has cited Zhao's family members as saying the incumbent Premier Wen Jiabao, who used to work for Zhao Ziyang, had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Zhao Ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. He was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85. </seg>

<seg id=7> The new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The new product for the "Severe Weather Information Center" website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes. </seg>
<seg id=9> It was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone's previous locations after it had disappeared. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing. </seg>
<seg id=11> To serve this purpose, the new product saves the tropical cyclone's grades, locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance. </seg>

<seg id=4> Professor Guan Yi, Director of the Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong's Joint Influenza Research Center, says that current data shows that the death rate of the deadly infectious bird flu virus is much higher than that of the SARS virus. </seg>
<seg id=5> Previous tests used to take three to five days to ascertain infection and sometimes more than a week. </seg>
<seg id=6> The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technology employs the methods of ELISA and Gold Agglutination tests to examine such samples as nasal or throat secretions and chicken embryo culture for whole or split viruses and blood serum to confirm any infection with the bird flu virus as quickly as within 1 hour or no more than 2 hours. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new technique is simple, convenient, and easy to apply on the spot in epidemic-stricken areas. It is 90% accurate and helpful for early discovery, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent the wide spread of the epidemic and large-scale disaster. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=6> On the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, China has always strictly abided by relevant international conventions, firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form, and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations, talks and the strengthening of international supervision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The spokesman points out that it is regrettable that Mr. Hyde has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as Sino-US relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development, which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of China and the US, goes against the mainstream voice in US asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with China, and is certainly harmful to the development of Sino-US relations. </seg>

<seg id=1> China's Largest Seawater Desalination Project to Be Kicked off in Zhoushan </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 6th from Hangzhou (by Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun) - China's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far, with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons, is to be kicked off in the Putuo District of Zhoushan city in Zhejiang Province. </seg>
<seg id=3> For residents in Zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages, the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to relevant authorities, a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and the Liuheng Township government of Zhoushan city. </seg>
<seg id=5> The project costs 50 million Yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water. It is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland. The first-stage of construction is expected to be completed next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan is one of Chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage. </seg>
<seg id=7> The entire city consists of 1,390 islands. The per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters, which equals to only 25.4% of the per capita average in Zhejiang Province. The problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city. </seg>
<seg id=8> Taking Liuheng Township in Putuo District as an example, some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 Yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The technique of seawater desalination by reverse osmosis, developed by the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration, is a process of membrane separation through the driving force of pressure, which at present is a focal point for current global seawater desalination research. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to the persons in charge from the center, both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater desalination by reverse osmosis project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost of seawater desalination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 Yuan. </seg>
<seg id=12> This indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is expected to approach that of tap water and industrial water. </seg>

<seg id=1> Three Gorges Project's Underground Powerhouse to Begin Construction </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Wuhan (by staff reporter Shi Yongfeng) - The principal part of the underground powerhouse of the Three Gorges Project began inviting bids for the first time on December 8th, which preludes the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Project design calls for installation of 26 700-MW water turbo generator units with an installation capacity of 18,200 MW. After their full operation, the units will generate an annual average of 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> To further tap its power generation potential, the Three Gorges Project has reserved a location for the construction of an underground power station in its preliminary design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to the chief from the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power station is located in mountains to the right side of the Three Gorges Dam. Major structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main plant buildings, tailrace systems, bus shafts, and a 500-KV transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> Six 700-MW power generation units will be installed in the underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=7> As a result, the total number of generating units in Three Gorges Project will increase from 26 to 32 and the installed capacity will increase from 18,200 MW to 22,400 MW, dramatically improving the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood prevention is a top priority in the construction of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> According to the operation and control plan of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir will need to be lowered from its normal level of 175 meters to the flood prevention level of 145 meters before the start of flooding season each year. </seg>
<seg id=10> As a result, the construction of the underground power station will raise the water exploitation index of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reducing abandonment of water, increasing power generation capacity and maximizing the station's non-flood peak adjustment period when abandonment of water is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id=11> At present, the preparatory projects such as the excavation and construction work of the underground power station's tributary canals, tailrace canals and supporting structures have already begun. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources say the underground power station will be fully completed and operational at the end of 2008. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> On December 11th 1929, Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi led and launched the renowned Bai Se Uprising and founded the Youjiang Revolutionary Base and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Bai Se Uprising was another successful armed revolt independently led by the communist party following the Nanchang Uprising, Qiushou Uprising and Guangzhou Uprising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the morning of December 11th, more than 2,000 people with flowers in their hands came to the memorial monument for the Bai Se Uprising to lay wreaths and bow... in commemoration of the martyrs' outstanding achievements. </seg>
<seg id=6> They later watched a movie named "the Bai Se Uprising" and visited a photo exhibition of "Zhang Yunyi in Guangxi". </seg>
</p>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 13th from Shanghai (by reporter Liu Dan) - "The China Youth Social Education Forum --- 2004 Media and the Development of Minors", which ended on the 13th in Shanghai, has proposed that China should introduce a spokesman system in respect of the status of minors to regularly release news on the current development and existing problems of minors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A recent poll conducted by the relevant organizations in Shanghai showed that minors spend an average of 1.17, 1.05 and 0.99 hours each day on extracurricular books, TV and the Internet. About half of their after-school time is spent on the media, which, as a brand-new social force, has become a factor that can't be neglected in minors' growth and development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "Media is a window that connects the youths hearts and the outside world. When the window is opened, fresh air comes in. So do flies and mosquitoes", </seg>
<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, President, Shanghai ShanDa Networking (Group) Co., Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While the media may offer beneficial conditions for the healthy development of minors, due to the needs of market competition and economic benefits as well as a lack of quality with some media people, the viewpoints in published articles may easily mislead minors in their thinking and values. Even worse is the dissemination of violence and pornography in some media. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, there are more than 2,000 TV channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies with 1,868 radio programs. The number of domestic Internet users has reached 87 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Officials of the forum say that the establishment of a spokesman system for minors will offer authoritative investigation data on the current development and problems of young people and change the current "false voices" of the media to create a healthy and favorable environment of public opinions for minors' development. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) UN Warns of Rise in Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua New Agency report of December 17th from Vienna (by staff reporter Song Guocheng) - The Executive Director of the UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Costa, warned in a press statement on the 17th that due to the production increase of Heroin in Afghanistan, the world's black market price of Heroin was expected to stabilize with a concurrent increase in drug purity, which is expected to result in more deaths of drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has issued warnings to health and anti-drug officials in Europe and its neighboring countries, calling on them to pay attention to the latest trends in Afghanistan's drug cultivation and in international drug-related crimes, and calling on them to take appropriate preventive measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistics by the Vienna-based UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94% in 2001 when opium plantation was forbidden in the country. In the following year, Heroin's degree of purity in Europe's black market decreased by 50%. </seg>
<seg id=5> Between 2000 and 2002, drug-related deaths in Europe dropped by 20%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa says that compared with 2003, the plantation area of opium in Afghanistan has increased by 64% this year with Heroin's production reaching up to 500 tons; higher than the global black market's one-year trade volume. The trend indicates that the degree of drug purity in the world will rise and drug-related deaths will increase accordingly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa says the drug source in Afghanistan is posing a "clear and real threat" to the world's anti-drug efforts. The increase of Heroin supply in the black market means the "death verdict" for drug users. </seg>

<seg id=1> National Top-Level Node for Domain Names to Settle in Shanghai </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 21st from Shanghai (by staff reporters Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu) - The China Internet Information Center and Shanghai Information Industry (Group) Company Limited signed a deal on the 21st regarding the establishment of a national top-level node for domain names in Shanghai. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Domain names are the basis of communications on which all Internet sites use for E-Business, E-Government, and other applications. At present, they are widely used as Internet addresses. </seg>
<seg id=4> People wishing to visit websites or send or receive emails must first enter a domain name.  The information transfer is then realized through the domain name system's analysis service which switches the domain name to an IP address to reach the website's servers. </seg>
<seg id=5> The domain name system is like a "nerve system" controlling information transfers on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to Mao Wei, Director of the China Internet Information Center which is in charge of China's national top-level domain name system, the number of China's Internet users has exceeded 90 million so far, ranking second in the world while the number of websites has surpassed 650,000. </seg>
<seg id=7> The analysis volume of domain names goes along with the use of the Internet. The analysis volume of domain names has quickly risen with the speedy development of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=8> The number of domain name registrations ending with "dot CN" increases by 10,000 every month, and has reached 430,000 so far. </seg>
<seg id=9> The national top-level domain name server operated and managed by the China Internet Information Center processes more than 380 million domain name analysis requests each day, with an average of over 4,400 requests per second and more than 8,000 at peak times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Facing the fast development of the Internet, the China Internet Information Center, the regulatory body in China for registration of domain names, has reevaluated 4 original national top-level nodes for domain names and redeployed its top-level nodes for dot-CN domain names based on such assessment. </seg>
<seg id=11> In accordance with its Internet development level and the software and hardware conditions of the user units, Shanghai has been selected as the location for installing the national top-level node for domain names. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources say there are 45,000 dot-CN domain names in Shanghai so far, with Internet prevalence reaching 26.6% and both it's Internet prevalence and application levels leading the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> There are 130,000 more dot-CN domain names and 230,000 websites in the Eastern China regions neighboring Shanghai, with an advanced development level. </seg>
<seg id=14> As a result, Shanghai has been chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Becomes World's Largest Hard Alloy Producer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 22nd from Nanchang (by staff reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) - China's hard alloy industry has seen rapid development over the past several years with annual output now exceeding 1/3 of the world's total. In terms of scale and output, China has become the largest hard alloy producer in the world, having a large variety of hard alloy products and the ability to produce most of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This was learned on the 22nd by the reporters from the ongoing China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Seminar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy is called "industrial teeth". Due to its high hardness and durability, it is used for cutting tools, high-tension tools as well as for mining and road-building machinery. The development of the hard alloy industry plays a key role in the development of the whole tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sources say that China's hard alloy sector started from scratch in the 1950s and has continued its development, winning outstanding achievements in the process. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s, the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons while China's annual output was around 5,000 tons. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China's output has rapidly reached 15,000 tons, accounting for more than 1/3 of the world's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Marked progress has also been made in China's hard alloy exports. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China's hard alloy exports were only 100 tons but in 2003, exports reached 2,500 tons. This year exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for 1/3 of the world's hard alloy market trade, a share similar to that of its output. The foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports has increased to $70 million annually from under $4 million in the past. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 23rd from Beijing (by staff reporter Jiang Guocheng) - Sources from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on the 23rd that the ADB has recently approved a $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province, which will generate power by utilizing methane produced in coal mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The coalbed methane development demonstration project will utilize the latest technologies to boost coalbed and coalmine methane production to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant to be built soon. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the project plan, it will offer at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed methane annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial and commercial consumers after its completion in 2008. </seg>
<seg id=5> Some 410,000 people in the Jincheng area will benefit. </seg>
<seg id=6> Shanxi's coal production accounts for around 1/3 of the nation's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The total cost of the project is estimated at $237 million, with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation offering a loan of $20 million and China Construction Bank offering a loan of $37.86 million. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two of the local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling $61.24 million. </seg>
<seg id=9> The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a $500,000 grant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane captured from surface well while drilling an underground coal mine is called coalbed methane while methane generated from underground coalmining operations is called coalmine methane. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is highly explosive and needs to be drained before mining operations to ensure safe working conditions. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help ease global warming and climate changes. </seg>
<seg id=13> Methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. </seg>
<seg id=14> Using methane to replace coal can also increase the use of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and result in cleaner air. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB principal project specialist, says the project is expected to result in some 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emission reductions. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 24th from Jerusalem - Director of the Israel Museum, James Snyder, said on the 24th that an ivory pomegranate, a most precious possession of the museum, had been recently confirmed as a fake. </seg>
<seg id=3> The ivory pomegranate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of King Solomon time's First Temple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that the Israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the Bronze Period, much earlier than the First Temple Period of the Jewish people. </seg>
<seg id=6> The Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate reads: "Belonging to the Temple of Lord Jehovah, holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> However, the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The ivory pomegranate was bought from an anonymous collector by the Israel Museum for $550,000 in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure inlaid on the top of a scepter by a priest of the First Temple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder says the ivory pomegranate was identified as authentic by Israeli experts including archaeologist Nahman Avigad before its purchase. </seg>
<seg id=11> Israel's Haaretz reports that Avigad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magnifying glass. </seg>
<seg id=12> The claim has been rejected by Avigad himself. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen to Enforce the Use of "Reclaimed Water" in Some Office Buildings and Residential Quarters </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 26th from Guangzhou - As a major step in building a "water-saving" city, Shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings and residential quarters. At present, relevant design specifications and regulations for the "Reclaimed water" are being drafted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" refers to municipal and living wastewater which, after being treated, can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be reused to some extent as undrinkable water. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water. </seg>
<seg id=5> "Reclaimed water" is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets, gardening and farm irrigation, cleaning roads, car washes, city fountains and supply water for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> An survey by the Shenzhen Water Board shows that more than 70 buildings had "reclaimed water" collection systems in Shenzhen in the mid-1990s. However, due to technology, design and management problems, all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing "reclaimed water". </seg>
<seg id=7> Only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 Yuan is needed to install "reclaimed water" processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is estimated that if all the existing 70 "reclaimed water" systems were put into operation, 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in Shenzhen each day, based on an average 500 tons of "reclaimed water" to be consumed daily by each residential quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Sources say Shenzhen's "reclaimed water" collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original "reclaimed water" systems. It will be further popularized based on the experience from the test-run. </seg>
<seg id=10> Meanwhile, Shenzhen's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out "reclaimed water" design specifications and enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Auctioned Assets of Yuganskneftegaz Not to Be Included in Gazprom </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 30th from Moscow (by Staff Reporter Song Shiyi) - The Director of the Russian Presidential Office and Chairman of the Russian Natural Gas Industrial Corporation (Gazprom), Medvedev, told the press on the 30th that Gazprom would merge the Russian Oil Company (Rosneft) as scheduled in January but Yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary company of the Yukos Oil Company purchased by Rosneft, would not be included in Gazprom's assets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In another report, when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of Yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of Gazprom, Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share-holder of the Russian Oil and Natural Gas Industrial Corporation and the nation didn't want to increase its overwhelming share. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said Yuganskneftegaz's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the 19th this month, the Russian Federal Asset Foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79% of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos Oil Company's largest subsidiary company. The newly formed Baikal Finance Group won the bid with $9.35 billion. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the 22nd, the state-owned Rosneft announced it had purchased Baikal Finance Group, which won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz's shares, to become the new shareholder of Yuganskneftegaz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Analysts say one of the important reasons for Russia's maneuver of the auction of Yuganskneftegaz's assets is to position itself in a leading position in relevant legal disputes. </seg>
<seg id=8> In September this year, Russian President Putin approved Gazprom's merger of Rosneft. </seg>
<seg id=9> Gazprom was founded in February 1993 and is the world's largest company in natural gas exploration. </seg>
<seg id=10> The company holds 65% of Russia's natural gas reserves. </seg>
<seg id=11> Last year, the company's gas output accounted for 93% of that in Russia and 20% in the world. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 31st from Chennai (India) (by staff reporter Jiang Yaping) - Southeastern India's Tamil Nadu State boasts a well developed fishing industry. </seg>
<seg id=3> The state has more than 1,000 kilometers of coastline with annual marine product exports reaching 370,000 tons and earning 23 billion Rupee (1 US dollar equals to 43 Rupees) for the local government. </seg>
<seg id=4> However, the rare tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in the Indian Ocean on the 26th has inflicted unseen heavy losses on the local fishing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to authoritative sources from the fishing industry in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, the unexpected disaster has had a great impact on the state's fishing industry. </seg>
<seg id=6> Because there were no warnings or precautions before the disaster, all the fishing boats were anchored in the bay. </seg>
<seg id=7> As a result, more than 7,000 motor vessels and over 30,000 barges in the State have been destroyed to varying degrees, accounting for more than 80% of all boats. In addition, over 30,000 fishing nets have been destroyed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Officials from the Chennai Fishing Industry Association said on the 31st during interview by Xinhua that even if the fishing boats are repaired, fishermen dare not go out to sea in the next few months as they have seen with their own eyes the sea's rampage and ferocity. </seg>
<seg id=9> Some have lost their loved ones and some have suffered economic losses. Their psychological fears will remain for a fairly long time. </seg>
<seg id=10> It is estimated that the State's fishery output in 2005 will decline by 30% as compared with that of 2004. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> During the tsunami on the 26th, most of the coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu State were affected, becoming the most seriously hit area in India. </seg>
<seg id=12> By the 30th, the State has recorded a death toll of 6,230, most of them being fishermen. </seg>
<seg id=13> Sources say some 680,000 people were affected by the tsunami with 85% of them engaged in the fishing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> At present, the Indian government is actively carrying out rescue operations in an effort to restore the livelihood of local fishermen and fishing production as soon as possible. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Hong Kong to See Economic Growth of Approximately 6% in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency Report of January 11th from Hong Kong (by staff reporter Su Xiao) - The APEC Study Center at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on 11th expressed its optimism about the world's economic environment this year, with an expected economic growth of 6% in Hong Kong and a 4.4% growth in the first quarter of this year on an annual basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Speaking at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" press conference, the Director of the HKU APEC Study Center, Richard Y.C. Wong, said despite an expected rise of the interest rate, Hong Kong's major trading partners' slow economic growth and the economic growth of 3.6% and 8.5% in the US and the Chinese mainland respectively, the global economic environment still holds good prospects for 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said the center predicted that Hong Kong's economic growth would remain at approximately 6% while the consumer prices would rise 3% at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> The reshuffling of the labor market will remain slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to approximately 6.3% at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=6> The uncertainty resulting from the fluctuation of global oil prices remains the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Executive Director of the center, Alan K.F. Siu, said the economic growth momentum is expected to be moderate in the first quarter of the year, with the total local output increasing by 4.4%. The slowdown reflects a weakening in external demand, as Hong Kong's major trading partners are growing slower than expected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, Hong Kong's real GDP growth is estimated to be a very robust 8% in 2004, with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5% and deflation finally contained in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast said the Hong Kong economy saw a robust growth in 2004, which reflected the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The foreign trade sector was very competitive and was able to capitalize on the strong and fast economic growth last year in the rest of the world and the mainland. The defeat of deflation would enable businesses to enjoy stronger cash flows. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and Johnson, a US marine, was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by US television stations.  The star-crossed marriage, however, lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Meriam is a member of the Gulf State of Bahrain's royal family.  Johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love.  Their marriage, resembling a fairy tale, was once the theme of a TV drama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> However, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as Meriam filed with the court for divorce in Las Vegas, where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The pair met in 1999 when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> After he met this little princess who is still in her teens, both fell in love with each other, which changed his life tremendously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since their union was forbidden by the royal family, Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers, then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After a bitter immigration lawsuit with US authorities, the young couple finally got married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip known for its dazzling grandeur when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Johnson said that due to temptations in Las Vegas, otherwise known as a "Sin City," his constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family, and rumors of an assassination plot at his life, this star-crossed marriage eventually failed to survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos, while Meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city, frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Meriam deserted her husband a year ago. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said that economic output data from the largest country in Eurozone will continue to show dramatic monthly fluctuations, but the long-term trend in economic output will show a slow-down of economic growth. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index dropped sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Economists said, as the significant appreciation of the euro will continue to impact the economic confidence in the recent survey, there is no reason to expect any rebound in economic expectations index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> BNP economists said: "Considering that major factors driving down economic confidence, including the appreciation of the euro, the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in Germany, are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the December survey period, a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the survey of economists conducted by AFX News, AFP's financial news subsidiary, this index will again slip to 11 in December from 13.9 in the previous month. </seg>

<seg id=1> Political Crisis in Ukraine Enters Third Week as Opposition Calls for Continued Protests </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The turmoil in Ukraine triggered by the presidential election entered the third week as the opposition leader Yushchenko called on masses of supporters today to continue their street protests and blockade the presidential office and government buildings till outgoing President Kuchma sacks Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming repeat presidential run-off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko supporters have congregated in the capital Kiev for two weeks.  They blockaded the government buildings and camped on the main streets specifically designed by Russian experts for military parade.  The power of people they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of the presidential election held on November 21, the Central Election Commission to order a repeat run-off on December 26, and the parliament to approve firing Yanukovych.  However, Kuchma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital's Independence Square tonight that Kuchma should dismiss his government and reorganize the Central Election Commission and that both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said in this speech that kicks off the run-off on December 26: "There should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made. </seg>
<seg id=6> For fourteen days, this square has shown a love for Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their choice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said: "We're experiencing a struggle between good and evil.  The whole world is applauding for our victory, and the whole world is proud of Ukraine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> While the opposition increased the pressure on the ruling regime backed by Moscow, and Yushchenko and Kuchma faced anew a stand-off on constitutional reforms, Polish President Kwasniewski, Lithuanian President Adamkus, and Russian Special Envoy Gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev for another round of mediation. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The UNICEF annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children, half of the world's total, are brutally ravaged by poverty, war and AIDS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> UNICEF said the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as clearly laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, were often imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Ms. Bellamy, the UNICEF executive director, pointed out at the annual report launch in London, "When half of the world's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment, when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by AIDS, we have failed to deliver our promise to children." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Bellamy added: "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The statistical data jointly compiled by UNICEF and researchers from Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University revealed a horrific picture of children at risk in most part of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers found that some 640 million children worldwide lack adequate shelters, 400 million have no access to safe drinking water, 270 million have no healthcare, 140 million (mostly girls) have never attended schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> More seriously, researchers pointed out, at least 700 million children suffer from all sorts of "severe exploitation," including no access to information and public sanitation facilities. </seg>

<seg id=1> EU Resists China's Pressure for Lifting Arms Embargo </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The European Union rejected today the pressure from China's Premier Wen Jiabao to put a quick end to the arms embargo on China yet said it will work hard toward lifting the 15-year-old ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Netherlands, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency, made the above remark after the EU-China summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands said there should not be any guesses as to how the European Union is going to put an end to the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The European Union imposed the arms embargo on Beijing following the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although the issue of the arms embargo clouded this China-EU summit, both parties still signed some trade and other agreements at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the European Union claimed that these agreements have strengthened their mutual "strategic partnership." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The European Union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with China's Premier Wen Jiabao: "The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The statement said the Chinese delegation "welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao made no effort to hide his displeasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo "does not reflect the partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Wen Jiabao said: "This embargo was a result of the Cold War.  It cannot reflect the current situation, nor can it reflect the partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Led by France, some EU countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted, claiming this embargo is already out of date. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Without adding any amendment to strengthen the related EU laws, some wise EU officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floodgates to arms sales and help enhance China's military capabilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende said: "I have explained that the European Union has the wish to lift the embargo, but I have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the Code of Conduct on arms exports." </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Study Yields Inconclusive Finding that Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A latest health study pointed out that "folic acid," a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects, may increase the risk of getting breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> However, researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show folic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer.  Therefore, they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid, found naturally in dark-color leafy vegetables, is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the two universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain kept track of 3,000 women who, in the 1960s, either took five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The report carried in the British Medical Journal said that by September 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milligrams of folic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed that this result was only "preliminary...intended to point toward the way toward further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said: "It is entirely possible that this is a chance result.  So further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of folic acid. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said "there is a considerable difference between the trial dosage" and the current suggested dosage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid, more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> The two opponents confronting each other in Ukraine's presidential re-run on the 26th of this month have now readied themselves for a decisive battle. </seg>
<seg id=3> Pro-Western opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of winning the election, while pro-Moscow incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych says he will no longer run on behalf of the "shameful" ruling party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the meantime, Russia's President Putin changed his stance toward Ukraine's EU accession, saying he would be happy to see Ukraine join the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re-run, Yushchenko said to reporters who packed the conference room: "To be conservative, I should be able to get about 60%." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> On the other hand, Yanukovych, anxiety written all over his face, evaded directly answering reporters' questions several times and finally said simply: "By God's will, we will win." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> Yanukovych, originally trained by current President Kuchma as his successor, has now made a departure, positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone, while promoting his new movie "Alexander" in Istanbul, tried to take the chance today to make peace with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" was criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In a special interview here he told AFP: "It has never occurred to me that this screenplay would be against Turkey.  This screenplay is meant to be against injustice everywhere." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Turkey has been denouncing Stone ever since the premier of this award-winning movie in 1978. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The movie was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, a young American, got arrested at Istanbul airport while trying to smuggle hashish from Turkey.  After a protracted lawsuit, he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey. </seg>

<seg id=1> Thai Premier Thaksin Still Expected to Win Elections in February Next Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> When Thai Premier Thaksin heads into 2005, he is confident of winning a second four-year term.  However, his reputation has already been tarnished because he has failed to quell a bloody separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> As Thailand's national elections have been scheduled for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections.  In the opinion of most analysts, he is expected to win despite this year's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> This year a total of twelve people in Thailand died from bird flu, which swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand. The Thai government frankly admitted it "made a mistake" in its handling of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, this health concern is unlikely to ruin Thaksin's chance of a second term. On the contrary, many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be, and what will his election victory mean to the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Kraisak, chairman of the parliamentary Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs, told AFP: "The phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at Thaksin, he has won broad popular support at this moment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said: "But things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and those close to him), the social injustices and the violence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is exactly because of social injustice and violence, insurgency broke out in the Muslim-dominant deep south of Thailand, where sporadic separatist incidents have occurred continuously since January. </seg>

<seg id=1> Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Claims Arafat Was Poisoned about a Year Ago </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Abdelrahman, Cabinet secretary for late Palestinian leader Arafat, disclosed that Arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Abdelrahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper: "About a year ago, something strange happened to Arafat.  It was on September 25, 2003. </seg>
<seg id=4> At that time the chairman was shaking hands one by one with some 30 representatives of supporters.  Shortly afterwards, the chairman started to vomit. </seg>
<seg id=5> Since then the chairman's health started to deteriorate gradually." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Arafat died of a mysterious illness in a French hospital on November 11. </seg>
<seg id=7> Some of Palestinian top officials thought Arafat had been poisoned. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, French doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Two weeks before the delegation visit to Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sharon had just made the decision to depose Arafat, only without specifying by what means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> This threat from Israel prompted a wave of people's support for Arafat, who subsequently received several delegations of supporters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Abdelrahman recalled, "Arafat shook hands with these people who came to express their support for Arafat besieged by Israel." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> On September 25 last year, Arafat received two groups successively.  One was a group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission.  The other was a group of political activists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Abdelrahman pointed out, "October 12 this year was the last time when Arafat got ill.  The symptoms were the same, vomiting, lack of appetite and all the similar symptoms of having the flu." </seg>

<seg id=2> US President Bush admitted today that Iraqi troops are not yet ready to replace US troops and warned that the elections scheduled for January 30 next year would not spell the end of serious violence in Iraq. </seg>

<seg id=2> US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage issued warnings to Syria today, saying the development of future relations between Damascus and Washington depends on whether Syria wants to cooperate with the United States on the issues of Iraq and Lebanon. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> Armitage renewed greater pressures on Syria when he was interviewed by reporters from Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id=4> The interview was released earlier by the State Department. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Asked whether he expected continued tensions between the United States and Syria, Armitage replied: "I certainly hope the relations will be improved, but this depends on how (Syrian President)Al-Assad and his men behave." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The US State Department Number Two pointed out that Damascus should implement the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 passed in September this year and end as soon as possible all interferences in its neighboring country Lebanon. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) signed a lease today for a new building site in Neihu.  Douglas Paal, director of the AIT Taipei Office, said the new building is now being designed, and that he hopes it will be completed soon so the institute's work can be done in a safe and modern facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Douglas Paal and TECRO Secretary General John Chen signed a 99-year lease for the new AIT office building site at noon in Taipei's Chun Yue Hotel. </seg>
<seg id=4> Witnesses were David Keegan, deputy director of the AIT Taipei Office, and Jacqueline Liu, deputy secretary general of TECRO.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Mark Chen was also present for the ceremony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> AIT, established under the Taiwan Relations Act to handle unofficial civil exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Douglas Paal said in his speech that AIT has been working with TECRO and the Taipei city government for over a decade to find a new AIT office building site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said the current office at Hsing Yi Road looks shabby and lacks enough space. </seg>
<seg id=8> For AIT, relocating to the new office building will be a challenge, as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout Taipei to operate in a safe and modern facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to Taiwan's architecture and become a point of pride for Taipei residents. </seg>
<seg id=10> Upon completion of the planning and design, contract bidding will be set for construction, which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision.  It is hoped that groundbreaking will take place within the next few years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> AIT spokeswoman Dana Shell-Smith said the building's cost, including the site lease and architectural design, is estimated at about US$160 million.  Its completion in 2008 depends on many factors, though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible. </seg>

<seg id=2> Russian President Putin said today that Russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of Russia's oil giant Yukos, a first move of re-nationalization in the post-Soviet era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Referring to Rosneft's acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz, a Yukos subsidiary, Putin said at the end-of-year press conference held in the Kremlin: "Russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism. </seg>
<seg id=4> And I consider this perfectly normal." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Rosneft today has become the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikalfinansgroup which won Yuganskneftegaz earlier at a secretive auction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Earlier last midnight Rosneft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100% of shares of the previously unknown Baikalfinansgroup. </seg>
<seg id=7> The acquisition allows Kremlin to have a tight control of Russia's critical energy sector. </seg>
<seg id=8> For nearly 18 months in the past, Russian authorities had been attacking Yukos and its imprisoned billionaire founder Khodorkovsky. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Since Rosneft is merging with Gazprom, combined with Yuganskneftegaz, the consolidated trio will control one fifth of Russia's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world's largest energy group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Putin justified the state's current acquisition by criticizing the under-the-table privatization in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id=11> The privatization measures at that time caused the crown jewels of the Russian economy to fall into the hands of a few slick businessmen such as Khodorkovsky. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) today kicked off the promotion of an advanced Internet program, through which, it hopes, 20% of Japan's workforce can "telecommute" to work from home by 2010 so as to reduce the stress of office work and its consequent toll on families. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> An MIC official said that currently some 4 million Japanese, or 6% of Japan's workforce of 63.2 million, take advantage of science and technology to work from outside office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Beginning January, six MIC staffers can stay away from office at least one day in a week and work instead from their homes, universities, or libraries through the high speed Internet services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Based on feedbacks, the MIC will expand the scope of this advanced program until 20% of its 2,500 employees can work from home by 2006. </seg>

<seg id=6> The MIC official said that this program allowing employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing is expected to "improve workplace efficiency." </seg>

<seg id=2> The WHO said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in the Indonesian province of Aceh ready to provide medical assistance to tsunami survivors. </seg>

<seg id=1> Powell Predicts Shiite Victory in Iraqi Elections </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> US Secretary of State Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the upcoming Iraqi elections, but he also believed there should not be too much concern that the Shiite victory may increase Iranian influence because there are past disagreements between Iraqi and Iranian Shias. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> There has been growing evidence that Sunni Muslims may boycott the elections on January 30 or may be prohibited from participating in the elections by the relevant Iraqi authorities due to their spreading of insurgency. </seg>

<seg id=4> Powell said on NBC's Meet the Press program: "The new government going into power and the transitional national assembly will be majority Shiite. </seg>
<seg id=5> The majority of Iraqi population is also Shiite." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Shiite Muslims make up more than 60% of Iraq's population, living mostly in southern and central areas. </seg>
<seg id=7> On the other hand, Sunnis live in central and western provinces and comprise 20% of the population. </seg>

<seg id=1> Behind Tsunami Catastrophe Relief Efforts Lies Political Jostle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> As Asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas, a less praiseworthy operation is also secretly underway: Governments are jostling over who should be giving money, who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> The catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled the old fire of war, including the discord among the United States, the United Nations and Europe, and the struggle for leadership in Asia. </seg>

<seg id=4> Relief experts, however, are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent: Governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Juma, professor of international development of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said: "Promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100% and on time." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> With pledged donations from governments hitting US$2 billion, major players in the international political arena including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell, and leaders from Australia, China and Japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political overtones in Jarkata on the 6th. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It was alleged that NHK took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders.  Liberal media criticized NHK for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex slavery. </seg>

<seg id=4> However, conservative newspapers defended NHK's decision to edit the program, believing the company's senior executives were obligated to ensure the fairness of the program content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The controversy broke out last week over a program aired in 2001 that featured a mock trial on the crime the Japanese military committed in drafting women as sex slaves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found late Japanese Emperor Hirohito guilty because he allowed Japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=7> Historian said at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as sex slaves in frontline Japanese military brothels during the war.  They were mostly from South Korea but some of them also came from Taiwan, China, Philippines and Indonesia. </seg>

<seg id=2> Three weeks after suffering the strongest tsunami attacks in history, survivors are now grappling with the vices of bureaucracy and politicization, while the world's focus has shifted elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Thousands of decaying bodies continue to be dug out from debris, pushing the death toll of the December 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000.  In the meantime, the upcoming Iraqi presidential elections and Bush's inauguration ceremony have replaced the tsunami disaster as the world media's top headline news. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Indonesia has retracted its original demand that foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid missions withdraw within three months. </seg>
<seg id=5> In Thailand, leaders from Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Finland are discussing reconstruction and efforts to identify dead bodies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> However, survivors are facing new difficulties, such as Indonesia's deep-rooted bureaucracy, which has impeded the distribution of relief supplies pouring in from all over the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> In a small village near Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh Province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, fisherman Busriadi said: "It seems like we do not even exist.  The tsunami hit us very hard.  We have lost everything and we are starving." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said: "Where are the food, clothing, and other relief supplies we saw on TV pouring into Aceh?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Like thousands of other disaster victims, Busriadi lost his identity card and other official documents due to the tsunami, which turned his efforts to get relief supplies into a nightmare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Although he has been begging officials and shuttling daily from one place to another to process paperwork, the result is always the same: no relief aid for him. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy in China said that before ousted former CPC Secretary General Zhao Ziyang died of illness this morning, China's Vice President Zeng Qinghong visited him in the hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Information Center said that according to Zhao Ziyang's family, Zeng Qinghong visited him at 6:00 this morning in a Beijing hospital before his death about an hour later.  Zhao was 85. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Formerly CPC secretary general and premier, Zhao Ziyang was ousted because he opposed the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement in 1989.  He had been under house arrest since then and had lost favor within the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Information Center said that according to Zhao's family, Wen Jiabao, incumbent premier who used to work under Zhao Ziyang, did not come to visit him when he was critically ill. </seg>
<seg id=6> However, before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, he was visited by Tian Jiyun, the retired Party Central Committee member who once worked as his assistant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy in China has been in regular contact with the Zhao family and has released accurate information about Zhao Ziyang at opportune times for many years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Information Center said that some twenty key retired officials from the Party, the government, and the military plan to issue a public letter to the CPC calling for a reevaluation of Zhao Ziyang's contributions and demanding a public memorial service for him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The Center added that Zhao Ziyang's family will not receive permission to host or prepare a funeral.  The final decision on relevant arrangements will be made by the Party. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Widely Urged to Push for Democracy in the Wake of Zhao Ziyang's Death </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> While the world lavished praise on former CPC leader Zhao Ziyang after his death from illness today, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwan government, and overseas Chinese democracy campaigners all urged Beijing to push for democratic reforms envisioned by Zhao Ziyang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Ousted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement, Zhao Ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a Beijing hospital this morning.  He was 85. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to Jiji Press, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi said in memory of Zhao Ziyang: "I hope they (China) make efforts toward democratization." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Taiwan also urged China to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of Zhao Ziyang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Overseas Chinese democracy campaigners praised Zhao Ziyang as "one of the greatest reformers in China" who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Lian Shengde, president of the New York-based Free China Movement and former student movement leader, said: "During the 15 years of his house arrest, he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy. </seg>
<seg id=8> Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a man of principle." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Some democracy activists are demanding that the Chinese government hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, they admit the unlikelihood of Zhao Ziyang receiving such treatment because of Chinese government's fears that a public dissatisfied with the CPC ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest. </seg>
<seg id=11> As it was, the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang. </seg>

<seg id=12> A brief report released by Xinhua News Agency today that Comrade Zhao Ziyang had died of illness in Beijing was the only related official statement. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The observatory spokesperson said the two new services are: adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the WWIS website and adding a recap function to display the tropical cyclone tracks of the past seven days to the SWIC website. </seg>
<seg id=4> These two services represent Hong Kong Observatory's provision of yet another new service after it provided the global heavy rain (including snow) official observation data to the SWIC at the beginning of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It is learned that the WWIS website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for major world cities. </seg>
<seg id=6> The new service provides, for the first time, global official weather observations with a global map of cloudiness and rain as a pilot program. </seg>

<seg id=1> World's First Quick Diagnostic Kit for Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Developed in Shantou </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, December 3 (Zhang Siwen and Lin Junqiang) Reporters learned that the Joint Influenza Research Center, partnering the medical schools of Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong, has developed the world's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus H5N1, following its nearly six months of work with Xiamen University. </seg>
<seg id=3> Using this quick testing method to test a suspected case specimen can produce a conclusion about bird flu infection in as fast as one hour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to an introduction given by Professor Guan Yi, head of the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools, the highly pathogenic and deadly bird flu actually has a much higher mortality rate than the SARS virus, based on current available data. </seg>
<seg id=5> Previously it took at least three to five days, and at times more than one week, to confirm the diagnosis of a "suspected" case of the virus. </seg>
<seg id=6> This successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a gold-based dipstick.  Specimens able to be tested include excretions, nasal or throat secretions, whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embryo, and serums.  A conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour, and at most within two hours. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new technique is simple, convenient, and fast.  The test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90% accuracy.  It can aid the early detection, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious virus, and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Entrusted by China's Center of Disease Prevention and Control, the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country.

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2nd in Hong Kong by Hyde, chairman of the US House Committee on International Relations, for his vicious attacks on development and progress in China and his Cold War-style defiling of China's foreign policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesperson said it is commonly known that China's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people, but also supports worldwide prosperity and development. </seg>
<seg id=5> On the international stage, China is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the issue of nuclear nonproliferation, China has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form.

These remarks, totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by Chinese and US presidents recently, run counter to the mainstream voice of the US community for strengthened cooperation with China and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the China-US relationship. </seg>

<seg id=3> For Zhoushan residents, who have long suffered from water shortage, the seawater that has surged around them for thousands of years will soon be turned into fresh, sweet running water flowing into tens of thousands of households. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=4> Reporters learned from relevant departments that the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township Government of Putuo District, Zhoushan City have recently signed a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalinization project with daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons. </seg>
<seg id=5> With daily production of 10,000 tons of fresh water, the 50-million-yuan seawater desalinization project would have the mainland's largest treatment capacity so far.  The project's first phase is expected to be completed by next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan is one of the cities in China with serious water shortages. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are 1,390 islands of various sizes within the city.  Fresh water per capita is 601 cubic meters, which is only 25.4% of the average fresh water per capita in Zhejiang Province.  Water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city's residents. </seg>
<seg id=8> In Putuo District's Liuheng Township for example, 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The reverse osmosis seawater desalinization technology developed by the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration is a pressure-driven membrane separation process, currently a hot subject in international seawater desalinization research. </seg>
<seg id=10> The relevant authority at the center said that through technological improvement and by retrofitting domestic-made equipment, both the costs of the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization project and its energy consumption have been reduced. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost of seawater desalinization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Cusco (Peru) December 7 (Reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu) The Special Summit of the Presidential Council of the Andean Community (CAN) opened on the 7th in Cusco, a famous tourist city in Peru. </seg>
<seg id=3> Participating presidents or their representatives will discuss such issues as deepening integration in the Andean region and promoting economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Peruvian President Toledo said at the summit's opening ceremony that although the Andean Community has been established for 35 years, some major issues such as poverty have still not yet been resolved. </seg>
<seg id=5> Currently, poverty rates in the Andean region are as high as 53%, posing a serious threat to democratic administration in the region. </seg>
<seg id=6> All governments in the Andean Community must therefore try hard to establish effective poverty reduction mechanisms and to increase levels of public participation in state affairs, so as to promote social stability and development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Toledo said that although there are many issues within the Andean Community that need to be resolved, great progress has been made in Latin American integration in recent years.  The establishment of the South American Community of Nations will be declared at the Third South American Presidential Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>
<seg id=8> He said he believed the establishment of this new regional organization will play an important role in promoting political, economic, and social development in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> In addition to Toledo, Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=10> Colombian President Uribe, Ecuadorian President Gutierrez, and Venezuelan President Chavez were unable to attend the meeting for various reasons, but they will come to attend the Third South American Presidential Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Established in 1969, the Andean Community is composed of five countries, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru.  It is a regional organization through which Latin American countries promote economic cooperation.  The Community is headquartered in the Peruvian capital of Lima. </seg>
<seg id=12> The Presidential Council is the highest-level decision-making body of the Andean Community and holds a meeting every year. </seg>

<seg id=1> Construction of Three Gorges Project Underground Power Station to Begin Soon </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 8 (Reporter Shi Yongfeng) On December 8, the first public bidding was held for the principal part of the Yangtze Three Gorges Project underground power station, kicking off construction of the Three Gorges underground power station. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Project design calls for the installation of 26 700-MW water turbine generating units, for a combined capacity of 18,200-MW, which upon completion will generate 84.7 billion kWh of electricity annually. </seg>
<seg id=4> In order to further tap the power generation potential of the Three Gorges Project, the preliminary design of the Project reserved space for expanding the underground power station. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to an executive with China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power station is to be set in the mountain on the right bank of the Three Gorges Dam, with its principal construction including intake tower, diversion tunnel, principal plant building, tailrace system, bus shaft, and 500kV transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> Six 700-MW generating units will be installed in the underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=7> Thus, the total number of generating units installed in the Three Gorges Project will be increased from the originally planned 26 to 32, while installed generation capacity will rise to 22,400-MW from 18,200-MW, significantly boosting the Three Gorges Project power generation capacity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood control was the primary objective for construction of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> According to the Three Gorges Reservoir operation coordination plan, the water level of the reservoir will be lowered from the normal pool level of 175 meters to the flood control level of 145 meters prior to the annual flood season. </seg>
<seg id=10> Therefore, construction of the underground power station will increase water utilization in the Three Gorges Reservoir, reduce the amount of unused water, and enhance power generation capacity, maximizing the periods of peak calibration when no water goes unused. </seg>
<seg id=11> Currently, groundbreaking has already started for the branch tube, the tailrace, the support structure, and other preliminary projects for construction of the Three Gorges underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources said that the underground power station will be completed and put into operation by the end of 2008. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Ready to Establish A Sailing Festival </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8 (Reporter Huang Fuhui) Yao Mingde, chairman of the China Road Transport Association, said at a press conference held here on the 8th that he is "full of confidence" for establishing a China Sailing Festival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Yao Mingde, who also heads the organizing taskforce office for commemorating the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyage, said that 16 member departments of the organizing taskforce, including the Ministry of Communications, have reached consensus on establishing July 11 of each year, the day Zheng He made his first Western seas voyage, as China's Sailing Festival, and will make a proposal to the State for establishing this festival. </seg>
<seg id=4> Sources said the State Council approval is needed to establish non-holiday festivals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zheng He was a world-renowned navigator. </seg>
<seg id=6> During the 28 years from 1405 to 1433, Zheng He led a fleet of more than 200 ships and nearly 30,000 people on a succession of seven long sea voyages, sailing through Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean to arrive at the Red Sea and Africa.  His journey covered over 300,000 kilometers and included stops in more than 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China will host a series of events next year to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyages. </seg>
<seg id=8> The logo for the commemorative events was revealed in Beijing on the 8th. </seg>
<seg id=9> The logo comprises a sailboat braving the wind and waves as it sails west, a light blue billowy arching wave, and the text "600th Anniversary of Zheng He's Western Seas Voyage (1405-2005)." </seg>
<seg id=10> It was designed by Yao Ying, an art teacher in a junior high school in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> People from all walks of life have urged that a China Sailing Festival be established in 2005 to coincide with the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyage, and to use the opportunity to educate youngsters, thus enhancing public awareness of sailing and maritime concepts, passing down the spirit of the Chinese nation, and deepening patriotic education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Yao Mingde said that China has over 3 million square meters of sea territory and that 90% of China's goods in the international trade is transported by sea. </seg>
<seg id=13> As China is one of the world's large maritime nations, lack of a sailing festival among its various holidays does not make sense. </seg>
<seg id=14> Taiwan Province has already established July 11 as Sailing Festival day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=15> Sailing festivals are celebrated in about a dozen nations throughout the world, including the United States, Canada, and Japan. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> On December 11, 1929, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and others launched and directed the famous Baise Uprising and founded the revolutionary base of Youjiang and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Baise Uprising, following the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising, was yet another successful armed uprising led independently by the Communist Party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the morning of December 11, more than 2,000 people holding fresh flowers came to the Baise Uprising Monument to lay their flowers, bow in respect, and reminisce upon the martyrs' great achievements. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13 (Reporter Liu Dan) The "China Youth Social Education Forum 2004: Media and Development of Minors," which concluded in Shanghai on the 13th, proposed that China should establish a media spokesperson system regarding the status of minors, and regularly release information on existing problems and current development of the youth population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Relevant agencies in Shanghai recently conducted a survey showing that a minor spends an average of 1.17 hours per day doing extracurricular reading, 1.05 hours watching TV, 0.99 hours surfing the Internet, etc.  About half of a minor's free time is spent in a media environment, which, as an entirely new social force, is becoming an indismissible factor in shaping the growth and development of the youth population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "Media is a window that links the minds of youth with the outside world.  When the window is open, fresh air comes in along with flies and mosquitoes." </seg>
<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, chairman of the board of Shanghai Shanda Networking Development Co., Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While media creates a good condition for the healthy growth of minors, opinions expressed in the media, due to market competition, demand for profits, and the poor nature of some media professionals, tend to mislead youngsters' thoughts and values.  Some media even go further by serving as channels for violence and pornography. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, China has over 2,000 TV channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies.  There are 1,868 broadcast programs, and nationwide, as many as 87 million netizens. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17 (Reporter Song Guocheng) Costa, executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased production of heroin in Afghanistan, the expected price stability and enhanced purity of heroin in the global black market in 2005 will result in more drug-related deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has already sent warnings to health and anti-drug agency officials in Europe and neighboring countries, urging these nations to closely watch new developments in Afghan opium cultivation and international drug crimes, and to take corresponding prevention measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistical data provided by the Vienna-based UNODC, the production of heroin in Afghanistan dropped by 94% when opium cultivation was banned there in 2001.  The following year, the purity of heroin on the European black market declined by 50%. </seg>
<seg id=5> From 2000 to 2002, the number of drug-related deaths in Europe decreased by 20%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said that compared with 2003, the area of opium cultivation in Afghanistan this year has increased by 64%.  The production of heroin reached more than 500 tons, more than the total amount transacted in the global heroin black market in a year.  This trend indicates an increase in the purity of drugs worldwide and a commensurate increase in the number of drug-related deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa thinks that the source of drugs in Afghanistan constitutes a "clear and realistic threat" to global anti-drug efforts, and that the increased supply of black market heroin is a "death sentence" for drug abusers. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Has Become the World's Largest Producer of Hard Alloy </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 22 (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) In recent years China has seen rapid development in its hard alloy industry, with an annual output exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy production.  In terms of production scale and capacity, China has become the largest producer of hard alloy in the world.  Offering a full range of selection, China is capable of producing nearly all kinds of hard alloy products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Reporters learned this information on the 22nd at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Forum currently underway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy, known as "industrial teeth," is used to make cutting tools, high pressure tools, and mining and road construction machinery due to its extreme hardness and wear resistance.  Hard alloy industry development plays an important role in the development of the entire tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sources said that China's hard alloy industry, beginning from scratch in the 1950s, has grown steadily toward its current status through remarkable achievements. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s when the annual worldwide hard alloy output was 25,000 tons, China produced about 5,000 tons of hard alloy per year.  Entering the 21st century, annual global hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons, while China's hard alloy production has soared to 15,000 tons, exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy output. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China has also made significant progress in exporting hard alloy. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China exported only 100 tons of hard alloy annually.  By 2003, exports had reached 2,500 tons.  This year's exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of hard alloy market transactions worldwide, similar to China's share of total worldwide production.  Foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports increased from less than US$4 million annually in the past to US$70 million today. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23 (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) The reporter learned on the 23rd from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of the bank's recent approval of a US$117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province fired by methane released from coal mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The CBM (coal bed methane) Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technology to increase production of CBM and CMM (coal mine methane) to provide fuel for the 120-MW power plant to be constructed. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the plans, the project will provide at least 166 million cubic meters of CBM annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial customers upon its completion in 2008. </seg>
<seg id=5> It will benefit about 410,000 people in the area of Jincheng. </seg>
<seg id=6> Shanxi's coal output accounts for one third of the nation's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The project's total cost is estimated at US$237 million, of which US$20 million will be provided by a loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and US$37.86 million will be provided by a loan from China Construction Bank. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng Municipal Government and two mining/industrial corporations in the area will provide a total of US$61.24 million in equity capital. </seg>
<seg id=9> The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a US$500,000 grant for the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane recovered by drilling into a coal seam from the earth surface after completing construction of a mine well is called CBM, while methane released during underground coal mining operations is called CMM. </seg>
<seg id=11> A highly explosive gas, methane must be removed in advance of coal mining operations to ensure a safe work environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removing, collecting, and utilizing methane will reduce greenhouse emissions and help slow global warming and climatic change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> Replacement of coal with methane can also increase clean fuel usage, improve coal mine efficiency, and improve air cleanness. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB senior project expert, said the project is expected to account for about 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gas emission reduction quotas. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Israel Museum's Prized Possession Found to Be a Forgery </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, December 24  James Snyder, director of the Israel Museum, said on the 24th that the museum's prized possession, the ivory pomegranate, has recently been identified as a forgery. </seg>
<seg id=3> This ivory pomegranate was once considered the only artifact ever discovered of the First Temple in Solomon's time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts found it should be a relic of the Bronze period, dating back much earlier than the time of the First Jewish Temple. </seg>
<seg id=6> A line of Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate read: "Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> However, the inscription was identified as being later added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Israel Museum bought the ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector for US$550,000 in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archeologists and artifact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the First Temple priest in the top of a scepter and also the only relic left from that period of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder said that prior to the purchase, the ivory pomegranate was authenticated by the Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts. </seg>
<seg id=11> According to the report by Israel's newspaper Haaretz, Avigad ran a cursory examination of the relic using only a magnifying glass at that time. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad himself denied this allegation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police uncovered three large-scale antiquity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people. </seg>
<seg id=14> During the investigations, the police and the Antiquities Authority discovered by chance that the ivory pomegranate was a forgery. </seg>
<seg id=15> The police will indict some of the parties involved next week. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen to Mandate Use of "Reclaimed Water" in Some Complexes and Residential Subdistricts </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26  In a major effort toward building a "water-saving" city, Shenzhen will mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes and residential subdistricts.  Relevant guidelines and regulations on water reclamation design are currently being formulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" mainly refers to non-drinking water derived from treated urban waste water and domestic sewage, meeting certain water quality standards and reusable within a certain range. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its quality is between that of running water and sewage. </seg>
<seg id=5> In general it is used in large volume for flushing toilets, irrigating gardens and farmland, cleaning roads, washing cars, providing water for city fountains, and as supplementary water for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to an investigation by the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration, more than 70 complexes in Shenzhen were equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems during the mid-1990s, but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing "reclaimed water" associated with the technology, design, and management. </seg>
<seg id=7> To put these pipelines into actual use, it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a "reclaimed water" treatment system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Based on daily usage of 500 tons of "reclaimed water" by each residential subdistrict, Shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70-plus existing sets of "reclaimed water" pipelines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Sources said that Shenzhen's "reclaimed water" recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70-plus complexes that were originally equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems.  Further promotion will be based on assessment of feedbacks. </seg>
<seg id=10> In the meantime, the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration will work with city planning and construction departments to develop guidelines as soon as possible for water reclamation design and to mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> As soon as the tourists arrived at the beach, the sea water began to rise.  At first, everyone thought it was the rising tide, and so did not pay much attention. </seg>
<seg id=6> When the tour guide Cai Weiwei recognized the rapidly rising sea, she alerted everyone to race to the hotel on the nearby beach for shelter. </seg>
<seg id=7> By the time they had rushed into the hall of the hotel, the seawater had already flooded the hotel gate. </seg>
<seg id=8> The hotel had three stories but the surging waves flooded right through the second floor.  Nobody had any choice but to stay trapped on the top floor.  Fortunately, the seawater did not continue to rise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Of the 26 tourists, 19 were employees of China United Engineering Corporation. </seg>
<seg id=10> Reporters learned from that company that after the tsunami, the trapped employees called the company for help using their cell phones.  The company immediately requested emergency aid through China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id=11> Upon hearing the news, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand took emergency measures to rush rescue personnel to the site.  Two people were unaccounted for at that time. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 11 (Reporter Su Xiao) The Center for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Studies at the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that with the global economic environment still favorable, Hong Kong's economy is expected to grow about 6% this year, and 4.4% on an annual basis in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Yue-chim Wong, director of the Center for APEC Studies at the University of Hong Kong, said at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" release that although interest rates this year are expected to rise and economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners will slow down, with the US and Chinese economies expected to grow 3.6% and 8.5% respectively, the global economic environment in 2005 is still positive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said the Center projects that Hong Kong's economy will maintain growth of about 6% in 2005, while consumer prices will rise 3% by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Labor market adjustments will remain slow.  The unemployment rate will adjust slightly to about 6.3% by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Uncertainty triggered by fluctuating global oil prices will remain the major factor clouding Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Shao Qifa, the Center's deputy director, said that economic growth momentum will slow in the first quarter this year, with total local output growing by 4.4%.  The growth slowdown reflects Hong Kong's weakening external demand caused by further slowdown in economic growth among Hong Kong's major trading partners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to reports, Hong Kong's total output in real terms would record a robust growth of 8% in 2004, as average consumer price levels declined by a mere 0.5%, with deflation disappearing in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Zhou Yiqing, chairman of the preparatory committee for Hong Kong University's "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast," said that Hong Kong's strong economic growth in 2004 mainly reflects the stable foundations of the local economy and strong competitiveness in foreign trade markets.  Hong Kong benefited from robust global economic growth and rapid growth in the mainland economy last year, while the end of deflation also allowed business owners to enjoy more cash flow. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24 (Reporters Zhang Miaomiao and Wang Wentao) The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Bureau of Culture and Bureau of Parks issued simultaneously on the 24th seven regulatory safety codes regarding "crowded venues" such as shopping malls and parks. </seg>
<seg id=3> Deputy Mayor Lu Hao of Beijing Municipality believes that the formulation and issuance of these seven regulatory safety codes are the specific embodiment of the standardization of safety requirements in Beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the seven regulatory safety codes in their trial versions such as "Regulatory Safety Codes for Shopping Malls and Supermarkets in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Performance Venues in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Venues Offering Internet Services in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," and "Regulatory Safety Codes for Parks and Scenic Spots in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," strict numerical standards are all imposed on evacuation passageways and exits.  For example, "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Performance Venues in Beijing Municipality (trial version)" stipulate that the minimum net width of evacuation exits and evacuation passageways in commercial performance venues shall be no less than 1.40 meters. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bahraini Princess Marries a U.S. soldier; Astounding Marriage Dissolves in 5 Years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> U.S. television stations had once feted the marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam al-Khalifa and U.S. marine Johnson. However, after just five years, this star-crossed marriage has already come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Meriam is a member of the royal family of the Gulf country of Bahrain. Johnson risked his military career over this forbidden love affair. Their fairy-tale marriage was once the theme of a television movie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Nonetheless, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal, only five years later, the couple went to court when Meriam filed for divorce in Las Vegas, where getting married is quick but getting divorced is quicker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The two met in 1999, when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> After he met this teenage princess, the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the royal family forbade the union of these two young lovers, Johnson smuggled Meriam out of her country and into the United States by disguising her in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap, and forging her military identification papers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After fighting a difficult immigration battle with the U.S. authorities, the couple was finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip, famous for its opulence. At that time, Johnson was 23, and the bride was only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Johnson stated that because of the many temptations in Las Vegas, so-called "Sin City," the continuous tensions between him and Meriam's rich and powerful family, and the rumor of plots to assassinate him, this marriage, which had endured all kinds of hardships, finally dissolved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson said that he worked as a parking valet for hotel and casino guests, while Meriam gradually got sucked into the nightlife of the casino city. She frequented nightclubs late at night and ignored her husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Meriam left her husband a year ago. </seg>
<seg id=12> Johnson said, "She's gone off the deep end." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by Eurozone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said that economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to show great volatility every month, but the long-term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> This week's key figures will be in Germany. The closely watched economic expectations index, which is expected to be released on the 7th by the ZEW Economic Institute, will provide the first evidence of December's economic confidence in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index plummeted to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In a recent survey, economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the Euro will continue to affect economic confidence, thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> A BNP economist said, "Given that the main factors negatively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the Euro, uncertainty over global growth, and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in Germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news subsidiary, economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in December from 13.9 in the prior month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nevertheless, Teather of UBS Investment Bank said that the ZEW economic expectations index of Germany might even fall to zero in December. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> The chaos sparked off by the presidential election in Ukraine has entered its third week. Opposition leader Yushchenko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings, until outgoing President Kushma fires Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet, and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming rerun of the presidential runoff election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital city of Kiev for two weeks. They surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by Russian specialists for viewing military marches. Their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the Supreme Court to declare the presidential election on November 21 invalid. The Central Election Commission ordered a new election on December 26 and the Parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych. However, Kushma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor, whom he fostered personally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told the supporters gathered at the Independence Square tonight that Kushma should replace his government and reshuffle the Central Election Commission, and that both the Parliament and Kushma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> In his speech that unveiled the runoff on December 26, he stated, "Before these decisions are implemented, we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id=6> During these 2 weeks, this square has demonstrated its ardent love for Ukraine, and the civil awareness of tens of millions of Ukrainians who can defend their choices." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> An annual report published by UNICEF today shows that over 1 billion children, half of the world's children, suffer from poverty, war, and HIV/AIDS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> UNICEF pointed out that the rights of children to have a healthy and protected upbringing stated clearly in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child are frequently denied, partly because of governments' failure to implement human rights and economic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> During the launch of the annual report in London, UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out, "When half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Bellamy added, "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood." </seg>

<seg id=6> Data compiled jointly by researchers at UNICEF, the London School of Economics, and Bristol University reveals a gruesome picture of children in dangerous situations in most parts of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers discovered that about 640 million children worldwide lack proper shelter, 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water, 270 million children do not have health care services, and 140 million children (mostly girls) have never attended school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Researchers pointed out that a more serious fact is that at least 700 million children suffer from all forms of "extreme deprivation," including lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities. </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Findings: Possible Link of Folic Acid to Breast Cancer, But Results Inconclusive </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A recent health study suggests that a B vitamin (folic acid) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Nonetheless, researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding, because other research suggests that folic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer. Thus, they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the University of Bristol and the University of Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of folic acid or a placebo, mostly during their second and third trimesters of pregnancies in the 1960s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> This research, published in the British Medical Journal, showed that by September 2002, those who had taken 5 mg doses of folic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed that these results present "preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He stated, "It is entirely possible that this is a chance finding -- so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness said that women planning to become pregnant should continue to take folic acid supplements. </seg>
<seg id=10> He claimed that the current recommended dosage and "the experimental dosage are considerably different." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the UK's health standards, women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first trimester of pregnancies should have 0.4 mg of folic acid everyday, which is more than 10 times lower than the dosage taken by the women in the above study. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie "Alexander" in Istanbul to make peace with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" has been criticized as tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He told AFP in an interview here, "I never intended the screenplay to be against Turkey. It was against injustice everywhere." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Turks have condemned Stone since the first screening of this award-winning movie in 1978. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> This movie was adapted from the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, an American youth who was caught at the Istanbul airport for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country, was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison following a protracted legal battle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Turkish critics accused Stone of taking liberties with rewriting Hayes' original work into a racist screenplay. All the Turkish characters in the movie are depicted as villains without exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The movie is also full of horrific prison scenes of rape and torture. </seg>

<seg id=10> Stone admitted, "Perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much, too hard." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, he added, "It was true that Billy Hayes did get sodomized in the Turkish prison. He was convicted to a 30-year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning, and he was also treated brutally in prison. So this is all based on the facts." </seg>

<seg id=1> Japanese Economic Growth May Slow Down Next Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending, Japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stagnation, but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on China despite the rising political tensions between the two countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id=5> According to the newly adopted statistical methodology, the Japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the July-September quarter, narrowly escaping a technical recession. </seg>

<seg id=2> Russian President Putin stated today that the state's purchase of Russian oil giant Yuko's major asset was to protect the interests of the state. It is also the first re-nationalization action taken in the post-Soviet era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> When discussing the state-run petroleum company Rosneft's purchase of Yuko's subsidiary company, Yuganskneftegaz, at the end-of-the-year press conference in the Kremlin, Putin stated, "Today the state, using absolutely legal market mechanisms, is protecting its interests. </seg>
<seg id=4> I consider this absolutely normal." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Rosneft became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikal Finance Group, the company that won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz at an earlier secret auction. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> Rosneft issued an unexpected announcement a little before midnight last night - that it has acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown Baikal Finance Group. </seg>
<seg id=7> This acquisition gives the Kremlin solid control over the energy industry, which is vital to Russia. </seg>
<seg id=8> In the past 18 months, Russia has repeatedly attacked Yuko and its billionaire founder, Khodorkorsky, who is presently in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Rosneft is merging with state-run Gazprom. With the addition of Yuganskneftegaz, the three together will control one fifth of the total oil production in Russia and all its natural gas production, thus becoming the world's largest energy group. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=10> Putin defends the state-purchase actions by criticizing murky privatizations in the 1990s. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications launched an advanced Internet program today, in the hopes that by 2010, 20 percent of the Japanese workforce can "telecommute" from home through this program in order to reduce stress from office life and disruptive family problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> An official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that currently, approximately 4 million Japanese, representing 6 percent of the total workforce of 63.2 million people, utilize technology to work outside the office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Starting in January, six Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications employees will be working outside the office, either from home, from universities, or from libraries through high-speed Internet service at least once a week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand the scope of this advanced program based on feedback, until 20 percent of its 2500 employees can work from home by 2006. </seg>

<seg id=5> Rosaviakosmos responded, "No direct influence of space-related activities on the population's health has so far been established." </seg>

<seg id=2> According to rumors, NHK toned down a program about women who were forced by the Japanese army to become prostitutes during the Second World War that aired a few years ago, due to pressure from political figures. Japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to sources, NHK cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians. Most of the interviewees were critics of Japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes. NHK's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Nonetheless, conservative newspapers defended NHK's decision to revise the contents of the program, stating that the company's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program's contents. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> The dispute, which focused on a program aired in 2001 about a mock trial of the crime committed by the Japanese army of forcing women to become prostitutes during the war, erupted last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial was held by a Japanese women's rights group in December 2000. The verdict found late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the Japanese army to commandeer prostitutes during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1 (Reporter Jiang Wei) - With the completion of the trial run of a 660,000-kilowatt power-generating unit, Shanghai Turbine Generator Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of Shanghai Electric Group, reached its annual production target of 15 million-kilowatt units on the 1st, a date earlier than planned. The achievement thus enabled Shanghai to leap to lead the world in both output and production capacity of power plant equipment and fulfilled the wish of several generations of the Chinese equipment manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Shanghai Electric Group is the largest power plant equipment-manufacturing base in China. </seg>
<seg id=4> With the rapid growth in the demand for power-generating equipment in China in recent years, power generator manufacturers across the country have entered a phase marked by huge growth and major development. </seg>
<seg id=5> Shanghai Electric Group consolidated the favorable resources of power plant equipment including steam turbines and power plant boilers. After undertaking the production of four million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generating units, it has also acquired production orders for nine heavy-duty fuel-powered electric generating units and three waste heat boilers through a combined bidding. </seg>
<seg id=6> Meanwhile, through an integrated operation, it has further enhanced its business management, technology development, and production efficiency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, Shanghai Electric Group holds 40 percent of the market share for the Chinese power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America. </seg>
<seg id=8> This year alone, Shanghai Turbine Generator Co., Ltd has received a RMB 6 billion yuan sales order for the main engine components of the power generating equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Zheng Jianhua, president of Shanghai Electric Group, said that the "power shortage" this summer had boosted the demand for power plant equipment across the country. The competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is gradually becoming white-hot. </seg>
<seg id=10> The group is putting into practice its three objectives of "developing and producing million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generation, gas turbine generating units, and million-kilowatt grade nuclear power" in order to achieve its goal of rising to the world's 500 strongest as soon as possible. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Hong Kong Observatory to Provide New Services for WMO </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 12 - The Hong Kong Observatory will launch two new services for the "World Weather Information Service" and "Severe Weather Information Center" websites hosted by the World Meteorological Organization, starting December 2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A spokesman for the observatory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of cloudiness and rain to the "World Weather Information Service" website and a recap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the "Severe Weather Information Center" website. </seg>
<seg id=4> These two programs are another new service that the Hong Kong Observatory is offering after it started providing the "Severe Weather Information Center" with official observation information of heavy rain (including snow) in areas around the world earlier this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to information, the "World Weather Information Service" website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for the world's major cities. </seg>
<seg id=6> The new service, for the first time, provides global official weather observations with the cloudiness and rain distribution map as its first project introduced. </seg>
<seg id=7> The weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density, with eight scheduled updates per day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The new product of the "Severe Weather Information Center" website is to provide a recap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths. </seg>
<seg id=9> The previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissipated, information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes landfall. </seg>
<seg id=11> As a result, the new product will store information on the intensities, locations, and paths of tropical cyclones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated. </seg>

<seg id=1> World's First Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Strain Rapid Diagnostic Kit Successfully Developed in Shantou </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, December 3 (Reporters Zhang Yiwen, Lin Juniang) - Reporters obtained information from Shantou University Medical College/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center that after almost six months of collaboration with Xiamen University, they have developed the world's first rapid diagnostic kit for the bird flu virus H5N1 strain. </seg>
<seg id=3> A confirmation of whether a person has contracted the bird flu virus can be obtained in as little as an hour by testing a specimen from the suspected carrier with this rapid diagnostic method. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to Professor Guan Yi, director of Shantou University/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center, based on the information available now, bird flu, which is listed as a highly fatal pathogenic virus, has a case fatality rate much higher than the SARS virus. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the past, it would take three to five days or even more than a week to confirm a "suspected" case of virus infection. </seg>
<seg id=6> The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technique uses Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay techniques. Testable specimens include excrement, nasal or throat secretions, intact virus cultivated from chicken embryo, virus isolate, or serum. A confirmation of bird flu virus infection can be reached in as soon as an hour or within two hours at the latest. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new technique has the characteristics of being simple, convenient, and fast. Testing can be conducted at the outbreak site with an accuracy rate of over 90 percent. It can help the early discovery, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent a widespread and major disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shantou University Medical College/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center recently held a training workshop on bird flu testing techniques to train students from disease control and prevention centers in 20 provinces and cities across the country.

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesman claimed that China had expressed its strong displeasure with the speech delivered by Mr. Hyde, Chairman of the U.S. House International Relations Committee, in Hong Kong on December 2, which contained malicious attacks on China's development and progress, and tarnished China's foreign policy with his Cold War mentality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesman stated that people in the world know that not only is China's development in line with the basic interests of 1.3 billion Chinese, it is also beneficial to the world's prosperity and advancement. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the international political arena, China is a responsible country that has contributed positively and constructively to uphold world peace and stability. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, China has strictly enforced the international agreements and is opposed to any form of nuclear proliferation, and is advocating resolving these problems through negotiations, talks, and enhanced international monitoring. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> The spokesman stated that it was regretful that Mr. Hyde ignored the objective facts and issued such irresponsible statements at a time when the Sino-US relationship is heading towards healthy and stable progress. His statements contradicted the recent consensus in developing bilateral ties, reached by the state leaders of China and the U.S. They are running counter to the demand of mainstream U.S. society for enhancing the cooperative relationship with China, and will certainly harm the development of the Sino-US relationship. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 6 (Pan Yifeng, Xu Qun) - The largest seawater desalination project ever in China, with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons, will begin in Putuo District, Zhoushan City of Zhejiang Province. </seg>
<seg id=3> For Zhoushan residents, who suffer greatly from water shortages, the vast and mighty seawater that has been flowing by their side for hundreds and thousands of years will soon become clear and sweet tap water that runs into tens of thousands of households. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Information gathered by reporters from relevant departments showed that Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township government in Putuo District of Zhoushan City signed the cooperation agreement for a 10,000-ton seawater desalination project a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=5> The investment for the project is RMB 50 million yuan with a daily fresh water production capacity of 10,000 tons. Its treatment scale is the largest among all seawater desalination projects in China thus far. The first stage of the project is expected to be completed next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan City is one of the Chinese cities that suffers the most from water shortages. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are 1,390 islands of varying sizes in the city. On average, each person has 601 cubic meters of fresh water, only 25.4 percent of that of Zhejiang Province. Drinking water has always been a problem that affects the residents' lives in this island city. </seg>
<seg id=8> For instance, Liuheng Town in Putuo District has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day at a cost of more than RMB 10 yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The reverse osmosis seawater desalination technology developed by Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration is a membrane diffusion process powered by pressure and is the focus in today's international seawater desalination research domain. </seg>
<seg id=10> The relevant leading official of the center said that through the technological enhancement and improvement of equipment inside China, the cost for the reverse osmosis seawater desalination project and its energy consumption have both been lowered. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost for each ton of seawater desalination treatment will be further reduced from the existing RMB 5 yuan. </seg>
<seg id=12> It indicates that the cost for seawater desalination will hopefully approach the price of tap water and industrial use water. </seg>

<seg id=1> Three Gorges Dam Underground Power Station Construction Begins Soon </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 8 (Reporter Shi Yongfeng) - December 8. An invitation for a public bid for the principal construction of the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is underway for the first time, thus marking the inauguration of the construction project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Dam Project plans to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydro turbine-generating units with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. The average annual power generated after the entire unit goes into operation will be 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> In order to further develop the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Dam Project, a space for the construction of an underground power station was reserved in advance in its initial design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to a top official of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp., the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is located inside the mountains, to the right side of the great dam. Its main structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main powerhouse, tailwater system, vertical shafts, and a 500-kilovolt transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> Six 700,000kw-generator units will be installed in the underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=7> In this case, the total number of generators installed in the Three Gorges Dam Project will be increased from the original 26 to 32 units while the installed capacity will be increased from 18.2 million kilowatts to 22.4 million kilowatts, thus greatly improving the power generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood control is the priority mission for the Three Gorges Dam Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> According to the Three Gorges reservoir operation adjustment plan, every year before the flood season, the water retention level inside the Three Gorges reservoir will be operated at the lowered flood control limit level of 145 meters, from its normal 175 meters level. </seg>
<seg id=10> Thus, the construction of the underground power station will increase the water utilization index of the Three Gorges reservoir, reduce water wastage and increase power-generating capacity in order to maximize the impounding stream peak adjustment period of the power station. </seg>
<seg id=11> Currently, early construction projects of the Three Gorges Dam underground power station, including the digging of branch tunnels and tailwater ditches, as well as the construction of the prop-ups, have begun. </seg>
<seg id=12> According to sources, the underground power station will be completed and go into operation by the end of 2008. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Zheng He was a world-renowned mariner. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the 28 years between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led more than 200 fleets and close to 30,000 people to cross the vast ocean seven times through Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and Africa, sailing more than 300,000 kilometers and visited over 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China will hold a series of commemorative activities next year to celebrate the 600th Anniversary of Zheng He's expedition to the West. </seg>
<seg id=8> The logo of the commemorative activities was announced in Beijing on the 8th. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Abidjan, December 8 (Reporter Liu Shaoping) - The United Nations Mission in the Ivory Coast released a public statement in Abidjan on the night of the 8th, stating that UN Secretary General Annan expressed his welcome for the consensus reached among all parties in the continuous implementation of the peace agreement. He urged all parties to seize this opportunity to ensure that "true progress" would be achieved in the peace process in order to prepare for the October 2005 election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The public statement stated that Annan also stressed that all parties should reach a general agreement on the "concrete action roadmap." </seg>
<seg id=4> He also "had high hopes" for the continuous efforts of South African President Mbeki and the African Union to join hands with the Economic Community of West African States and the United Nations Mission in the Ivory Coast to resolve the crisis in the Ivory Coast. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Commissioned by the African Union, Mbeki conducted a four-day visit in the Ivory Coast from December 2 to 6 to seek a resolution for the crisis in the area. </seg>
<seg id=6> Mbeki announced at the end of his visit that all parties in the Ivory Coast had reached a consensus on the four suggestions. </seg>
<seg id=7> The suggestions included: to finish a relevant law enactment of the Marcoussis peace agreement, to disarm belligerent personnel, that all government ministers return to their posts to fulfill their duties, and to regain safety inside the Ivory Coast. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Parliamentary party chairs from the Ivory Coast decided in a meeting a few days ago that the parliament would start deliberations on relevant proposals on the constitutional reform starting the 10th. </seg>
<seg id=9> Opposition rebels in the Ivory Coast also announced on the 8th that their leaders would hold a meeting in the near future to have an overall evaluation of the peace roadmap and to discuss the issue of disarmament. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> A coup and a civil war broke out in the Ivory Coast in September 2002. </seg>
<seg id=11> During last January and this July, major political parties in the Ivory Coast and representatives of opposition rebel parties reached an agreement in France and Ghana respectively to resume peace and bring about national reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, implementation of the agreements has met with many obstacles, and the peace process thus suffered repeated setback. </seg>
<seg id=13> Opposition rebels, who control the northern regions of the Ivory Coast, announced in mid-October that they would recall their participatory representatives. The peace process in the Ivory Coast thus reached another impasse. </seg>
<seg id=14> In early November, a serious clash occurred between the Ivory Coast army and the French army stationed in the country. The incident caused further deterioration of the country's situation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13 (Reporter Liu Dan) - The "Forum on Social Education for Chinese Youth 2004 - The Media and the Development of Minors" that closed on the 13th in Shanghai suggested that China should establish a news spokesman system related to the situation of minors to release regular information on the current developmental situation of minors and the issues encountered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A recent survey conducted by relevant Shanghai authorities showed that minors spend an average of 1.17 hours per day reading leisure books, 1.05 hours watching television, 0.99 hours surfing the Internet...About half of the arrangements for minors' after-school time involve the media. The media has become a factor affecting the growth and development of minors with an entirely new social force that cannot be ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "The media is a window that connects the souls of minors with the outside world. Once the window is opened, while fresh air comes in, flies and mosquitoes will also enter," </seg>
<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, President of Shanghai Chengda Network Development Company, Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At the same time, the media is creating good conditions for the healthy growth of minors, due to market competition and the need for economic benefits, as well as the low quality of some news professionals; the viewpoints in scripts may easily mislead the thinking and value systems of the youth, while some media even disseminate violent and pornographic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> There are currently more than 2,000 television channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies that run 1,868 broadcast programs, and the number of Internet users in China has reached 87 million people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Relevant officials of the forum stated that the establishment of a news spokesman system for minors can supply authoritative study materials for the current situation and issues encountered in youth development, so that the media "nonsense talk" situation can be corrected and a beneficial public opinion environment for the growth of minors can be provided. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17 (Reporter Song Guocheng) - Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, warned in a press release on the 17th that because of the increase in heroin production in Afghanistan, it is expected that the global price of heroin on the black market is going to stabilize and the pureness will increase, thus resulting in the deaths of more drug addicts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has already issued warnings to officials of health and anti-drug agencies in Europe and its surrounding countries and called on these countries to pay close attention to the newest trends in Afghanistan drug cultivation and international drug-related crimes and to adopt relevant measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to the statistics numbers provided by the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, headquartered in Vienna, when the opium cultivation industry in Afghanistan was banned in 2001, heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94 percent and the pureness of black market heroin in Europe decreased by 50 percent the following year. </seg>
<seg id=5> In 2000 and 2002, the number of drug related deaths in Europe dropped by 20 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said that the area for heroin cultivation in Afghanistan increased by 64 percent this year, compared to 2003. Heroin production has reached more than 500 tons, higher than the annual transaction amount on the world heroin black market. This trend indicates that the global pureness of the drug will be higher and there will be a corresponding increase in drug-related deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa believed that Afghanistan as a drug source poses a "clear and present danger" to global anti-drug efforts. The increase in the supply of black market heroin implies a "death sentence" for drug addicts. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21 (Reporters Feng Yizhen, Chen Haiyu) - December 21. The China Internet Network Information Center and the Shanghai Information Industry Group signed a contract on locating the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A domain name is the communication basis for all Internet applications including the conducting of electronic business and electronic government affairs. At present, it is widely used for Internet addresses. </seg>
<seg id=4> Users have to enter the domain name before visiting websites or receiving electronic mail. Through the decoding service of the domain name system, the domain name will be converted into an IP address and find the host computer of the website to enable the information transfer. </seg>
<seg id=5> Just like the "nervous system," a domain name system controls information transmission on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Mao Wei, Director of China Internet Network Information Center, which manages China's state top-level domain name system, explained that to date, China has the second highest number of Internet users in the world with over 90 million people. The number of websites has topped 650,000. </seg>
<seg id=7> The decoding capacity of the domain name is in direct proportion to the usage of the Internet. With the rapid expansion of the Internet, the decoding capacity of the domain name is also developing at top speed. </seg>
<seg id=8> Currently, the registration volume of the domain name "CN" is increasing at a rate of 10,000 per month and has reached 430,000. </seg>
<seg id=9> The state top-level domain name server hosted and managed by the China Internet Network Information Center handles over 380 million domain name decoding requests per day at an average rate of over 4,400 times per second, with a peak value of more than 8,000 times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Confronted with the rapid development trend of the Internet, the China Internet Network Information Center, which manages domain name registration in China, conducted a reevaluation of the four original state domain name top-level nodes this year and made rearrangements for the "CN" domain name top-level nodes according to the evaluation results. </seg>
<seg id=11> The center decided to situate the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai, based on the local Internet development level and the qualifications of the accessing unit. </seg>
<seg id=12> According to sources, at present, there are 45,000 "CN" domain names in Shanghai, an Internet user popularity rate of 26.6 percent. Its Internet popularity rate and usage level are both the highest in the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> Regions in Eastern China neighboring Shanghai have 130,000 "CN" domain names and 230,000 websites. Their development levels are also among the highest of the country. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 22 (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan, Li Xingwen) - China's hard alloy industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Its annual output is more than one third of the world's total hard alloy output. From the production scale and output standpoint, China has become the world's largest hard alloy production country, with a whole array of alloy varieties and the ability to produce most of the products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The information above was gathered by the reporters on the 22nd, at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Symposium that is in progress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy is known as "industrial tooth." It is used as cutting tools, high-pressure tools, and machineries for mining and road construction because of its extremely high hardness and wear-proof capability. The development of the hard alloy industry plays an important role in the entire growth of the tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to information, China's alloy industry started in the 1950s of the 20th century, from the ground up. Through continuous development, it has made outstanding achievements so far. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s of the 20th century, when the world annual hard alloy output was at 25,000 tons, the annual hard alloy output of China was approximately 5,000 tons. Entering the 21st century, the world annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China's output has increased rapidly to 15,000 tons, constituting more than one-third of world's hard alloy production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China's hard alloy export has also achieved significant improvements. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China's alloy export volume was only 100 tons; while in 2003, the export volume reached 2,500 tons. It is expected that this year's export volume will be more than 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of the world's hard alloy market circulation capacity as in its output. The annual net profits of hard alloy have increased from less than U.S. $4 million in the past to U.S. $70 million nowadays. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23 (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) - The reporter gathered information from the Asian Development Bank's China Office on the 23rd that the bank has recently approved a US $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province, powered by methane produced during mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Coal Bed Gas Development Demonstration Project will utilize the newest technology to increase the output of coal bed gas and coalfield gas to supply the fuel for a soon-to-be constructed 120,000-kilowatt power plant. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the project plan, when the project is completed in 2008, it will supply approximately 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial users with at least 166 million m3 of coal bed gas per year. </seg>
<seg id=5> The project will benefit about 410,000 people in the Jincheng area. </seg>
<seg id=6> The total coal output of Shanxi constitutes about one third of the total national output. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The project is estimated to cost U.S. $237 million. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will provide U.S. $20 million, while China Construction Bank will provide U.S. $37.86 million. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining/industrial groups will provide a total of U.S. $61.24 million of capital. </seg>
<seg id=9> The U.S. Trade and Development Agency also awarded a grant of U.S. $500,000 to the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Through in-mine drilling from the ground surface, the methane obtained from the mineshaft after it is built is called coal bed gas, while that produced during underground mining is called coalfield gas. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is a highly explosive gas and has to be released in advance during the mining process in order to guarantee the safety of the work environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> The elimination, collection, and utilization of methane will lower the release of greenhouse gas and is useful in slowing down global warming and climate change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> The substitution of coal with methane will increase the consumption of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and make the air cleaner. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, Senior Officer of the Asian Development Bank stated that the project will hopefully provide approximately 4.5 million tons of emissions reductions of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas. </seg>

<seg id=6> A line inscribed in Hebrew lettering on the Ivory Pomegranate reads, "Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> The inscription was verified to be added afterwards. </seg>

<seg id=8> The Israel Museum spent U.S. $550,000 to buy this Ivory Pomegranate from an anonymous collector in the 1980s of last century. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeologists and antiquity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest's scepter in the First Temple, and the only relic left from that time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder claimed that before they bought the Ivory Pomegranate, Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts had authenticated the relic. </seg>
<seg id=11> According to Haaretz Daily, Avigad only used a magnifying glass to do a cursory check on the relic at that time. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad personally denied such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police have discovered three major antiquity forgery cases successively and have subpoenaed several hundred people. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen Enforces "Middle-Water" Usage in Buildings and Small Districts </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26 - Shenzhen will enforce "middle- water" usage in some larger-scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing "water-saving style" cities. At present, relevant specifications and regulations for the middle-water plan are being drawn up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Middle-water mainly refers to non-drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality, and can be reused in certain areas. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage. </seg>
<seg id=5> In general, it is widely used for flushing toilets, watering gardens and farmlands, cleaning roads, washing cars, and supplementing the water in city fountains and cooling facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> A study by Shenzhen Water Works showed that in the mid 1990s of the 20th century, more than 70 buildings in Shenzhen were equipped with the "middle-water"-recycling system. However, the cost of recycling for "middle-water" was too high due to technological, design, and management factors, thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it. </seg>
<seg id=7> Only RMB 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the "middle-water"-treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If the more than 70 existing sets of "middle-water" pipelines are being used, according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of "middle-water" in small districts, it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen per day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> According to information, the Shenzhen "middle-water"-recycling project will start with the remodeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the "middle-water"-recycling system. After summarizing the experience, the project will be further expanded. </seg>
<seg id=10> Meanwhile, Shenzhen Water Works will draw up specifications for the "middle-water"-plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce "middle-water" usage in some larger-scale buildings. </seg>
<seg id=11> The treated "middle-water" will first be used in watering the trees in and around the city. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> China Travel Service's Hangzhou office organized for 26 Zhejiang tourists and a tour guide to go visit Thailand on the 24th. </seg>
<seg id=4> Li Hui, Assistant Manager of China Travel Service's Hangzhou office, explained that on the morning of the 27th, the tour guide led the 26 tourists to leave Phuket Island and travel to PP Island for a visit. They arrived there at around 10 am local time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> After the tourists went ashore, the sea started to rise. They did not pay attention at first because they thought it was high tide. </seg>
<seg id=6> After Cai Weiwei, the tour guide, noticed that the sea was rising extremely quickly, she warned the people to run to the hotel by the shore to take refuge. </seg>
<seg id=7> By the time all of them arrived at the hotel lobby, the seawater had already reached the hotel door. </seg>
<seg id=8> The hotel had three stories. The surging waves inundated all the way up to the second floor so all they could do was to stay on the third floor. Fortunately, the seawater stopped rising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nineteen of the 26 tourists were employees of China United Engineering Corporation. </seg>
<seg id=10> The reporters learned from the company that after the tsunami, the stranded employees called the company for help through their cellular phones. The company thus requested emergency assistance immediately through China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id=11> After hearing the news, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand adopted emergency measures and sent personnel to the scene for rescue. At that time, two members of the tour had already lost contact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> The company did not get in touch with the two employees who followed other tour groups to retreat to Phuket Island earlier on until the night of the 26th.

<seg id=13> After the tsunami, the local transportation departments tried their utmost to rescue the wounded. </seg>
<seg id=14> At noon on the 27th, they were safely transported to Phuket Island. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30 (Reporter Song Shiyi) - Medvedev, Head of the Russian Presidential Administration Office and Chairman of Gazprom, told the press on the 30th that Gazprom will merge with Rosneft in January as planned. However, the assets of Yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary of Yukos purchased by Rosneft, will not be included in the assets of Gazprom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Moreover, according to reports, when discussing the reason why the assets of the auctioned Yuganskneftegaz will not be included in Gazprom's, Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko stated that it is mainly because the state is already the major shareholder of Gazprom and the state does not want to increase its stake above the controlling-shares limit. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said that Yuganskneftegaz's assets will be removed independently and transferred to an entirely state-owned company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the 19th of this month, the Russian Federal Property Foundation held a public auction on 76.79 percent of Yuganskneftegaz's shares, the largest subsidiary of Yukos. The newly established Baikal Financial Group won the bid with U.S. $9.35 billion. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the 22nd, the state-owned Gazprom announced that it had bought the shares of Baikal Finance Group, the company that won the bid of Yuganskneftegaz's shares, thus becoming its new owner. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Research Institute Predicts: Around 6 Percent Growth in Hong Kong Economy in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 11 (Reporter Suxiao) - The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong stated on the 11th that this year's global economic outlook is still optimistic. The Hong Kong economy is expected to have an approximate 6 percent increase this year, with a 4.4 percent growth on an annual basis in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Richard Wong, the Director of the APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong, stated in the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" press conference that even though the interest rate is expected to rise this year, the economic growth of Hong Kong's major economic partners will be weak, and the respective 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent growth in the U.S. and Mainland Chinese economies, the global economic environment in 2005 is still optimistic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He stated that the center predicts an approximate 6 percent growth in the Hong Kong economy in 2005, while the consumer prices at year-end will rise by 3 percent. </seg>
<seg id=5> The adjustment of the labor market is still slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to roughly 6.3 percent at year-end. </seg>
<seg id=6> The unstable situation caused by fluctuations in global oil prices is still the major uncertain factor affecting the Hong Kong economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Alan Siu, the Executive Director of the center said that the momentum of the economic growth in the first quarter will slow down and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will have a 4.4 percent increase. The slowdown reflects a weakening external demand for Hong Kong due to an even slower economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, the real GDP growth of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a strong 8 percent increase and the average consumer price level slightly drops by 0.5 percent, while deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast of the Hong Kong University, stated that the robust growth of the Hong Kong economy in 2004 mainly reflects the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The foreign trade market is competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the economic growth in the Mainland last year. The ending of deflation also enables businesses to have more cash flow. </seg>

<seg id=1> Beijing Concurrently Promulgates Seven "Crowded Venues" Safety Management Standards </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24 (Reporters Zhang Miaomiao, Wang Wentao) - Beijing's Commerce Administration, Culture Administration, and Parks Administration concurrently promulgated seven safety management standards regarding "crowded venues" such as shopping malls and parks on the 24th. </seg>
<seg id=3> Beijing Deputy Mayor Liu Hao believed that the enactment and promulgation of these seven safety management standards were concrete manifestations of the standardization of safety quality in Beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the seven safety management standard pilot programs, including the Beijing Shopping Mall, Supermarket Safety Management Standard (Pilot), the Beijing Commercial Performance Venues Safety Management Standard (Pilot), the Beijing Internet Web Surfing Service Business Venues Safety Management Standard (Pilot), and the Beijing Parks, Scenic Attraction Districts Safety Management Standard (Pilot), a strict number limit is set for anything that involves evacuation routes and exits. For instance, in the Beijing Commercial Performance Venue Safety Management Standard (Pilot), it is stipulated that the net minimum width of evacuation exits and routes of commercial performance venues should not be less than 1.4 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Liu Xingqi, the Chief Engineer of Beijing Parks Administration, told reporters that whether it is targeted at shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theatres, or parks, these seven Standards have studied, for the first time, the relationship between the space of the business and the number of customers, and set an explicit limit. For instance, in the Beijing Park, Scenic Attraction Districts Safety Management Standard (Pilot), it is clearly stipulated that park administrative organs should receive tourists according to the tourist capacity provided in the Park Design Standard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> These seven Standards will be piloted within the two months before and after the Chinese New Year and their official implementations will start simultaneously on March 24, 2005. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bahraini Princess Married US Soldier, Sensational Marriage Breaks up in Five Years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa's marriage with the humble US marine Johnson was once a widely hailed story by US television channels. However, their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after lasting for just five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The fairy-tale marriage between Meriam, a member of the Gulf state of Bahrain's royal family, and US marine Johnson, who devoted himself to this banned love affair, risking his military career, became the subject of a television movie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dissolutions are quicker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The two met in 1999 when Johnson was a career army man stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> But his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The young couple's union was forbidden by the royal family, so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers, taking her out of her home country to the US. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After a bitter immigration lawsuit against US authorities, the couple married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip famed for its magnificence when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Johnson said the wealth of temptations in the "sin city" of Las Vegas, ongoing tensions with Meriam's wealthy and powerful family, and rumors of a plot to assassinate him had finally contributed to the breakup of the thorny marriage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests, while Meriam increasingly indulged in the nightlife of the gambling town, frequenting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Meriam abandoned her husband a year ago. </seg>

<seg id=1> Eurozone Indicators This Week will Suggest Weak European Economy to Continue </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Economists said Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week would show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data was expected to show increased industrial activity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries would continue to indicate great volatility each month, but the long-term trend of economic output would suggest slowing economic growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The most crucial figure of the week will be from Germany, where the ZEW institute's economic expectations indicator, which is closely monitored by the market, is due on the 7th and will provide the first evidence of economic confidence in Europe for December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index slumped to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The euro's significant appreciation would continue to weigh on economic confidence in the recent surveys, so there's no reason to expect the indicator to rebound, economists said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "Considering that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the euro's appreciation, uncertainty in the global economy, and a worsening unemployment rate in the German job market have been a drag on future growth expectations during the December survey, a strong rebound in the index is unlikely," economists at BNP said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news services, the indicator will slip again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Teather of the UBS investment bank said Germany's ZEW economic expectations indicator could even drop to zero in December. </seg>

<seg id=2> The intelligence reform bill that the US Congress will try its best to pass this week is an ambitious plan by Republican President Bush to promote his second term, while his support rate among the Republican lawmakers will be his first major test after reelection. </seg>

<seg id=3> In a newspaper interview yesterday, Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey responsible for an investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington in the US, said the problem with the intelligence reform bill was that it had to go through Congress, and the process alone bode ill for future bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Ukraine heads into a third week of turmoil caused by the presidential election, amid which opposition leader Yushchenko today called on supporters to keep up the street struggle by besieging the presidential palace and government buildings until outgoing president Kuchma sacks Prime Minister Yanukovich and his cabinet members and takes steps to ensure the new upcoming presidential run-off is fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have massed in the capital Kiev for two weeks, besieging government buildings and camping in the main avenue specially designed by Soviet experts for viewing military parades. The power of people Yushchenko's supporters demonstrated forced the Supreme Court to annul the November 21 second-round presidential election and the General Election Commission to order a repeat of the runoff on December 26. While parliament has already voted to sack Yanukovich, Kuchma has not signed a decree to replace the successor whom he's been grooming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko tonight told supporters who gathered at Independence Square in the capital city that Kuchma should replace his administration and reshuffle the General Election Commission, and that both parliament and Kuchma should agree to revise the election law to prevent vote rigging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said in a speech serving as the prelude to the December 26 runoff that "until these decisions are made, there can be no talk of lifting the blockade of the government buildings or the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id=6> For 14 days this square has demonstrated a love of Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainians who are capable of defending their choice." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> More than one billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from the scourge of poverty, war and rampant AIDS, said an annual report released today by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The rights of children to a healthy and secure growing environment, as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are often jeopardized, due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms, UNICEF said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> "When half of the world's children are growing up in a hungry and unhealthy environment, when schools become targets of attacks and whole villages are destroyed by AIDS, we can no longer deliver on our promise to children," UNICEF executive director Ms. Bellamy said while releasing the annual report in London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Too many governments are making deliberate decisions that actually hurt children," Bellamy said. </seg>

<seg id=6> Statistics compiled through the joint efforts of researchers from UNICEF, Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University have revealed a terrible scenario of children at risk in much of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers found that some 640 million children around the world lack adequate shelter, 400 million children have no access to safe drinking water, 270 million children have no access to health care services, and 140 million children (mostly girls) have never been to school. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The EU's rotating president, the Netherlands, made the above comments after a China-EU summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands said there was no need to speculate on how the EU would end the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The EU imposed the arms embargo on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Though the issue of the arms embargo has shadowed the China-EU summit, the two parties signed several trade and other agreements during the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the EU hailed the agreements as having strengthened the "strategic partnership" between them. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao did not hide his displeasure at a press conference after the summit, saying the embargo "fails to reflect the partnership between China and the EU". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation or the partnership between China and the EU," Wen Jiabao said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=12> Some EU countries led by France are pushing for a lifting of the embargo, saying the ban is outdated. </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Study Finding: Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer, but No Conclusion Made </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A latest heath study reported that "folic acid," a vitamin B widely taken by pregnant women to prevent fetal malformation, may increase the risk of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> But the researchers said their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urged pregnant women to continue taking the supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid is found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables and is known to the medical community as a crucial aid in the growth of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who took either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo in the 1960s when they were pregnant, mostly during the second and third phases of their pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> By September 2002, breast cancer rates among those women who took the five-milligram folic acid were twice as high as those who took the placebo alone, said the report published in a British medical magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed the results were merely "preliminary ... aimed at pointing out the way for further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "It is entirely possible that this is a result of chance, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is any, before we reach any conclusions," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=9> Ness said women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said the current dosage recommendation "is far from the experimental dosage." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant or in the first phase of their pregnancy should take 0.4 microgram folic acid daily, which is more than 10 times smaller than the doses taken by those women in the study described above. </seg>

<seg id=1> Storm over Past Works not Calmed, Oliver Stone Seeks Peace with Turkey </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone, in Istanbul promoting his new film "Alexander," took the chance today to try to make friends again with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" was criticized as tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "I never thought the screenplay would be hostile to Turkey; it was intended to be against injustice everywhere," he told AFP in an exclusive interview here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Public opinion in Turkey has condemned Stone since the first showing of the award-winning 1978 film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The film was adapted from the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, a young American, was caught at Istanbul airport when he tried to smuggle Indian hemp out of Turkey. He was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish jail after a protracted lawsuit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Critics in Turkey have accused Stone of turning Hayes's original work into a racist screenplay, in which every Turkish character is depicted as a rascal without exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The film is also full of scary prison scenes of rape and torture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> "Maybe it was because I was young at that time and wanted to make the point too eagerly and too strongly, which resulted in some zealousness and some anger," Stone acknowledged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> But he added: "Hayes did get sodomized in the Turkish jail. He was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for a relatively negligible offense and was treated brutally in prison. So everything was based on the facts. </seg>

<seg id=12> "Seen from a larger perspective, Turkey is not the only country where the prison system doesn't work well. The United States has similar problems," Stone said. </seg>

<seg id=1> Japan's Economic Growth May Slow Down Next Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Japan's economy may slow down towards 2005 as yen appreciation and a widening gap between the rich and poor could break the harmonious atmosphere it enjoyed in the first half of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Though high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have restored Japan's confidence this year after a decade of stagnation, analysts count on China to bolster economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The evidence is emerging that Japan's economy could decline briefly in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decrease and manufacturers adjust inventories to avoid a glut. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Based on the new statistical method recently adopted, Japan's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1 percent in the July-September quarter, narrowly evading a technical recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Currently, economists remain widely separated on the strength of Japan's economic rebound. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers from France-based BNP Paribas Bank estimate Japan's economic growth may hit 2.3 percent in real terms for both the current fiscal year to next March and the next fiscal year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They call 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the US economy is strongly back on the track of recovery and Japanese consumer spending is making up for the slowdown in exports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> A more pessimistic view is from UFJ Institute economists, who estimate only 1.8 percent growth for the current fiscal year and a growth rate as low as 0.6 percent for the next fiscal year. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> On the eve of 2005, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident of winning a second four-year term, but his reputation is tarnished for his failure to quell a bloody separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With Thai national elections scheduled for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political rivals are gearing up for the election campaign. Most analysts believe that despite the fierce violent conflicts in the south and the bird flu, he is still expected to win. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> A total of 12 people died in Thailand this year from bird flu, which swept across much of Asia but was particularly severe in Thailand, where the Thai government acknowledged it "made mistakes" in coping with the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, this health issue is unlikely to derail Thaksin's reelection. Instead, many ask only how clear his sweeping victory will be, and what his victory will mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces. </seg>

<seg id=1> Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Says Arafat Poisoned About a Year Ago </seg>
</hl>

<seg id=2> Arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in the Ramallah headquarters, the late Palestinian leader Arafat's cabinet secretary Abdelrahman disclosed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago, on September 25, 2003," Abdelrahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper. </seg>
<seg id=4> "At that time, the president vomited after shaking hands one by one with some 30 supporter representatives. </seg>
<seg id=5> The president's health started deteriorating from then on." </seg>

<seg id=6> Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11. </seg>
<seg id=7> Several top Palestinian officials believed Arafat had been poisoned. </seg>
<seg id=8> But French doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet had just made a decision to "remove" Arafat from his post, although without specifying by what means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Israel's threat triggered waves of public support for Arafat, who therefore received several supporter delegations. </seg>

<seg id=1> Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Tries Telecommuting to Reduce the Stress of Office Life </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications today launched an advanced Internet program, through which it aims to have 20 percent of the Japanese work force "telecommute" from home by 2010, reducing the stress and family disruption brought about by office life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Currently, around four million Japanese, or six percent of Japan's 63.2 million working population, use technology to work away from their offices, said an official with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Starting from January, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will have six employees who don't need to go to their offices at least one day a week; instead they may work from home, universities or libraries through high-speed Internet services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Depending on their feedback, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand this advanced program until 20 percent of its 2,500 employees are able to work from home by 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The program, which enables employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing, is hoped to "improve the efficiency at work places," said the official with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said telecommuting would allow workers to spend more time with their family, allowing bread earners to give more help with household duties. </seg>
<seg id=8> He added that the program would also help reduce traffic jams, car emissions, and overcrowding in trams during rush hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He said the goal of this program is to raise the percentage of Japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and to 20 percent by 2010 "by encouraging the sharing of telecommuting expertise with private businesses." </seg>

<seg id=1> Political Intervention in NHK Program? Debate Erupts in Japanese Media </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Allegations that pressures from politicians forced the public-run Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) to shorten a program aired a few years ago on Japan's slavery of comfort women during World War II have left liberal Japanese media at odds with their conservative counterparts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Liberal Japanese media have assailed NHK for slashing large portions of interviews it had conducted, mostly with critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of enslaved comfort women, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But conservative newspapers have justified NHK's decision to edit the show, believing the company's senior management has a duty to ensure its programs are fair and objective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on the crime of the Japanese military of enslaving comfort women during wartime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women by Japanese military during Japan's occupation of Asian nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but also from Taiwan, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese military brothels during wartime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The program's producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th, disclosing that before the program was aired, senior NHK officials met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa, both of whom had expressed concerns over the content of the program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nagai said top NHK officials then edited and shortened the program. </seg>
<seg id=10> "NHK bowed to political pressure," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> The Information Center said that according to Zhao Ziyang's family, Zeng Qinghong visited Zhao Ziyang at the Beijing Hospital at 6:00 am this morning, about an hour before he died at the age of 85. </seg>

<seg id=4> Zhao Ziyang once served as the general secretary of the CCP and premier.

<seg id=5> The Information Center said that according to Zao's family, the sitting Premier Wen Jiabao, who once worked as Zhao Ziyang's subordinate, did not visit him when he was critically ill. </seg>
<seg id=6> But retired Central Committee member and his one-time aide Tian Jiyun visited him before Zhao Ziyang slipped into a coma on the 14th. </seg>

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwanese government, and overseas Chinese democracy activists all coincided in appeals to Beijing to carry out Zhao Ziyang's vision of democratic reforms. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> Zhao was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the democratic movement at Tiananmen Square. He was put under house arrest for the rest of his life and died this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85. </seg>

<seg id=9> Democratic activists have requested China hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and give fair appraisal for his achievements. </seg>

Ltd, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group, reached the annual production target of 15,000-megawatt units on the 1st, ahead of schedule. This makes Shanghai the world's No.1 producer of power plant equipment in both output and capacity, realizing the long-time dream of several generations of workers in China's equipment manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group is the largest power plant equipment manufacturing base in China. </seg>
<seg id=4> In recent years, with the rapid growth of demand for power generating equipment in China, generator manufacturers across the country have entered a period of high growth and great development. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group has integrated its advantageous resources in power generating equipment such as steam turbines and power plant boilers. After taking orders of four units of million-kilowatt thermal generators, it received production orders for nine heavy gas generator units and three waste-heat boilers by way of a lump sum tender. </seg>
<seg id=6> At the same time, through integrated operations, it further improved the efficiency of enterprise management, technical development and production. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=4> These two new services come right after Hong Kong's Observatory began to provide official observation data on global heavy rain (including snow) for the "Severe Weather Information Center" early this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It was mentioned that the "World Weather Information Service" website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatic data for major world cities. </seg>
<seg id=6> The new service provides, for the first time, global official weather observation, with the global distribution graphs of cloudiness and rain as its first service. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new web page features a wide coverage and high density and is updated regularly, up to eight times a day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The new product on the "Severe Weather Information Center" website is a recap function for tropical cyclone tracking. </seg>
<seg id=9> In the previous design, the website would no longer store information, such as the location, of a tropical cyclone once it had dissipated. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about a tropical cyclone several days after it has landed. </seg>
<seg id=11> Therefore, the new product stores information on the intensity, location and track of tropical cyclones for the past seven days, allowing the public and the media to retrieve needed information after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated. </seg>

<seg id=1> World's First Rapid Diagnostic Kit for H5N1 Bird Flu Virus Successfully Developed in Shantou </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> SHANTOU, December 3, Xinhua (Zhang Yiwen and Lin Junqiang) The reporters learned from the Shantou University's Medical College/University of Hong Kong's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center that they have developed the world's first rapid diagnostic kit for H5N1 bird flu virus, after half a year of cooperation with Xiamen's University. </seg>
<seg id=3> Using this rapid assay to test specimens from suspected cases, the diagnosis of bird flu infection can be made in as short as less than an hour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Based on existing information, bird flu, which is listed as a highly toxic killer virus, has a mortality rate far higher than that of the SARS virus, said Professor Guan Yi, director of the Shantou University's Medical College/University of Hong Kong's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center. </seg>
<seg id=5> Previously it would take between 3 to 5 days, and sometimes more than a week to confirm "suspected" viruses. </seg>
<seg id=6> The successfully introduced rapid test for bird flu viruses uses the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the gold-labeling assay to test specimens such as excreta, nasal pharyngeal secretions, chick embryo-cultured intact virus or split virus, as well as serum. The diagnosis of bird flu virus infection may be reached in one to two hours. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new techniques are easy, convenient and rapid, and allow for detection in the outbreak site. With an accuracy of more than 90 percent, they help with early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of the infectious virus, avoiding wide epidemic and severe plague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shantou University's Medical College/University of Hong Kong's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center recently hosted a training workshop on bird flu virus assay techniques for trainees from 20 provincial and municipal centers for disease prevention and control across the country, on which the latest rapid assay techniques for bird flu virus were demonstrated. </seg>

<seg id=1> Spokesman for Foreign Ministry Commissioner's Office in HK Expresses Strong Dissatisfaction with Speech of US House International Relations Committee Chairman Hyde </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) A spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong issued a statement on the 3rd, expressing strong dissatisfaction with a speech delivered a few days ago in Hong Kong by US House International Relations Committee Chairman, Rep. Hyde. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesman said that the speech delivered on the 2nd in Hong Kong by Mr. Hyde, chairman of the US House International Relations Committee, viciously attacked China's development and progress, and smeared China's foreign policy with cold-war mentality; "we are strongly dissatisfied with it". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesman said it is widely known that China's development is not only in the fundamental interest of 1.3 billion Chinese people, but also contributes to the world's prosperity and development. </seg>
<seg id=5> China is a responsible country in the international political arena and has played a positive and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability. </seg>
<seg id=6> Regarding nuclear non-proliferation, China has all along strictly complied with relevant international conventions, firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in all forms, and advocated settlement of such issues through negotiations, talks and by strengthening international monitoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The spokesman noted that Mr. Hyde, unfortunately, ignored these facts and made those extremely irresponsible comments at a moment when the Sino-US relations are heading towards soundness and stability. This is completely against the common understanding reached recently between the Chinese and US leaders on bilateral ties, it contradics the mainstream voices in American society advocating the strengthening of cooperative relations with China, and will undoubtedly do harm to the development of Sino-US relations. </seg>

<seg id=1> China's Biggest Sea Water Desalinization Project Settles in Zhoushan </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> HANGZHOU, December 6, Xinhua (Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun) The biggest ever sea water desalinization project in mainland China, with a daily treatment volume of up to 10,000 tons, will settle in the Putuo District of Zhoushan City, in the province of Zhejiang. </seg>
<seg id=3> For residents of Zhoushan, who have long suffered from water shortages, the vast sea water besides them will soon become clear and sweet tap water streaming into thousands of households. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The reporters learned from relevant authorities that the State Oceanic Administration's Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center and the government of Liuheng Town in Zhoushan's Putuo District signed a cooperation agreement a few days ago on a ten-thousand-ton sea water desalinization project. </seg>
<seg id=5> With a 50 million yuan investment and a daily fresh water output of 10,000 tons, the project so far is the biggest sea water desalinization project in mainland China. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan City is one of the water-starved cities in China. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are a total of 1,390 islands, large and small, across the city, with an average fresh water availability of 601 cubic meters per person, which is only 25.4 percent of the average level for Zhejiang Province. The water supply problem has long disrupted the lives of residents in the island city. </seg>
<seg id=8> Liuheng Town in the Putuo District, for example, has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day, and the cost per ton is over 10 yuan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The reverse osmosis sea water desalinization technology developed by the State Oceanic Administration's Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center is a pressure-driven film separation process, a hot topic in current international sea water desalinization research. </seg>
<seg id=10> Responsible personnel from the center said that through technological improvement and equipment localization, the cost and power consumption of the reverse osmosis sea water desalinization project have both been slashed. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost of desalinizing one ton of sea water will drop further to the level of 5 yuan. </seg>
<seg id=12> This forebodes that the cost of sea water desalinization is likely to be close to the prices of tap water and industrial water. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> CUSCO (Peru), December 7, Xinhua (Reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu) A special meeting of the Andean Community (ANCOM) Presidential Council opened on the 7th in Peru's famous tourist city of Cusco. </seg>
<seg id=3> Presidents or delegates attending the meeting will hold discussions on plans to deepen integration of the Andean region and on the promotion of economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In a message delivered at the opening ceremony of the meeting, Peru's President Toledo said it had been 35 years since the establishment of ANCOM, but major problems such as poverty were still unresolved. </seg>
<seg id=5> At present the poverty rate in the Andean region is as high as 53 percent, posing a serious threat to the region's democratic governance. </seg>
<seg id=6> Therefore, ANCOM member governments should seek to establish effective mechanisms to get rid of poverty and to promote public participation in national affairs, so as to improve social stability and development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Toledo said that although quite a few issues were yet to be addressed within the ANCOM, great progress had been made towards South American integration, and the establishment of a South American Community of Nations would be announced at the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>
<seg id=8> He expressed his belief that the creation of the new regional bloc would play a vital role in promoting the region's political, economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Apart from Toledo, Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=10> Colombian President Uribe, Ecuadorian President Gutierrez, and Venezuelan President Chavez were unable to attend the meeting due to different reasons, but they will come to the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>

<seg id=1> Construction of Underground Power Plant to Begin Soon for Three Gorges Project </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> WUHAN, December 8, Xinhua (Reporter Shi Yongfeng) Bids were publicly invited for the first time on December 8 for the main part of an underground power plant for the Three Gorges Project, a prelude to the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Project is designed to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydraulic generator units, with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. Once the generator units are all in production, the average power generation per year will be 84.7 billion kilowatt hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> With the aim to further explore the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Project, the Three Gorges Project has reserved spaces in its initial design for building an underground powerhouse as an extension project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to officials at the China Three Gorges Project Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power plant is laid out in the mountains on the right bank of the Three Gorges Dam, with major buildings such as the intake tower, diversion tunnel, main plant, tailrace system, busbar shaft and 500kv transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> The underground power plant will have six 700,000-kilowatt generator units. </seg>
<seg id=7> This will increase the number of generator units installed in the Three Gorges Project to 32 from 26 designed originally and the installed capacity will soar to 22.4 million kilowatts from 18.2 million kilowatts, which will significantly strengthen the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood Prevention is the top priority for building the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> Based on the operation schedule of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level in the Three Gorges Reservoir will be lowered from the normal pond level of 175m to the flood control level of 145m each year before the flood season. </seg>
<seg id=10> Therefore, the construction of the underground power plant will increase the water usage rate of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reduce water loss and increase power generation, thus maximizing the time of peak regulation without water loss. </seg>
<seg id=11> Currently, the earlier phase projects of the Three Gorges underground power plant, such as adit excavation, tailrace canal excavation and timbering, have begun in advance. </seg>
<seg id=12> It is said that the underground power plant will be fully completed and put into production by the end of 2008. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A survey conducted by a relevant organization in Shanghai showed that minors read extra curriculum books for an average of 1.17 hours per day per person, watch TV for 1.05 hours, and browse the Internet for 0.99 hours, meaning that in the extra curriculum schedule of minors, about half the time is spent with the media. And the media is becoming a factor not negligible in minors' growth and development as a brand new social force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "The media is a window linking the minds of the young to the outside world. Once the window opens, fresh air will flow in together with flies and mosquitoes," </seg>
<seg id=5> said Chen Tianqiao, chairman of Shanghai's Shanda Networking Development Co., Ltd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While the media is creating good conditions for minors to grow up soundly, the need for market competition and economic interests, plus the low quality of some media staff, has made opinions in some articles misleading for the thinking and values of teenagers, and some media even spread violent and pornographic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Currently there are over 2,000 television channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies in China broadcasting 1,868 radio programs, and the number of net surfers within the country is as high as 87 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Organizers of the forum said that the creation of a spokesman system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the status and problems of adolescent development and change the current status of "disorderly voices" from the media, so as to offer a sound and favorable public opinion environment for the raising of minors. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Iraqi Foreign Minister Said Iraqi Elections Face Three Major Problems </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> DUBAI (United Arab Emirates), December 14, Xinhua (Reporter Xing Xudong and Yan Yi) Zebari, foreign minister of the Interim Iraqi Government, said on the 14th in Dubai that Iraqi elections due on January 30 next year would face three major problems: worsened security situation that would hinder and disrupt the election process, turnout affected as voters dare not cast ballots out of fear for terrorist attacks, and ensuring the transparency and fairness of the elections to the greatest extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In a speech delivered at the "Arab Strategy Forum" in Dubai, Zebari said it's very important that Iraq holds the elections as scheduled, because the elections not only decide Iraq's new leader, but also define Iraq as a free, democratic and united country belonging to all Iraqis. </seg>
<seg id=4> He expressed his belief that the future Iraqi government will be a legitimate administration representing the Iraqi people and expressing their wishes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zebari said the US-led coalition is in Iraq to protect the country at the request of Iraq, since the current Interim Iraqi Government cannot control the security situation and lacks the ability to wipe out terrorists and saboteurs. </seg>
<seg id=6> The existence of the coalition has a time limit. According to UN resolutions, this will end after Iraq has completed its political process and a legitimate government has emerged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Zebari stressed that new Iraq will maintain its Arab and Islamic nature and comply with the Charter of the League of Arab States. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Iraqi people face the historic opportunity of rebuilding the nation on a new basis. Iraq will rise again and become an important member that makes contributions to its own ethnic group within the Arab family. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) United Nations Warns More Death from Drug Abuse Expected Globally in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> VIENNA, December 17, Xinhua (Reporter Song Guocheng) Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased heroin yield in Afghanistan, heroin is expected to trade at a stable price in black markets in 2005 and with higher purity, causing more deaths among drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has sent warnings to officials at health and drug prevention organizations in Europe and surrounding countries, urging those countries to closely follow the latest trends of drug cultivation in Afghanistan and international drug crime, and take appropriate precautions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistics from the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2001, when opium cultivation was banned in Afghanistan, heroin yield in Afghanistan declined by 94 percent, and the purity level of heroin in European black markets dropped 50 percent a year later. </seg>
<seg id=5> Deaths from drug abuse in Europe fell by 20 percent from 2000 to 2002. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said Afghanistan's opium cultivation area this year increased by 64 percent compared to 2003, and heroin yield topped 500 tons, which is more than the volume of global black market heroin trade for the whole year, a trend meaning higher purity on a global scale and commensurate increase in the number of deaths attributed to drug abuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa believed drug sources in Afghanistan have posed "clear and present threats" to global drug prevention efforts, and a greater supply of heroin in black markets means "death sentences" to drug users. </seg>

<seg id=3> This is the second Guantanamo prisoner the US military has ruled out as an enemy combatant. </seg>
<seg id=4> England said the Pentagon confirmed the prisoner's identity a few days ago, and the State Department would inform the prisoner's country of this decision and make arrangements for his release. </seg>
<seg id=5> But he didn't disclose the prisoner's name or nationality, and the circumstances under which he was captured. </seg>
<seg id=6> England refused to admit that the Defense Department had made a mistake in determining the identity of the Guantanamo prisoner. </seg>
<seg id=7> He said the military review panel responsible for reviewing the identity of Guantanamo prisoners reviewed 507 prisoners, confirming the identity of 230, of whom 228 were correctly classified as enemy combatants. </seg>

<seg id=1> Top-Level Node for Country Code Domains Settles in Shanghai </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> SHANGHAI, December 21, Xinhua (Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu) China's Internet Network Information Center and Shanghai's Information Industry (Group) Co., Ltd signed a contract on the 21st on the entry into Shanghai of a top-level node for country code domains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Domain names, which are now widely used as Internet addresses, are the communication basis for carrying out all Internet applications such as e-business and e-government. </seg>
<seg id=4> When visiting websites or accessing email, people have to first enter domain names. Through the resolution service of a domain name system, domain names are converted to IP addresses, and website hosts are then found, enabling information transfer. </seg>
<seg id=5> A domain name system is like the "nerve system" that controls information transfer on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> China has more than 90 million Internet users as of now, which is the second largest number worldwide, and the number of websites has topped 650,000, said Mao Wei, director of China's Internet Network Information Center, the administrator of China's country code top-level domain name system. </seg>
<seg id=7> The volume of domain name resolution is proportional to Internet users, and with the fast development of the Internet, the volume of domain name resolution also increases rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=8> At present, registration of CN domains grows by 10,000 every month, with a total number of 430,000. </seg>
<seg id=9> The country code top-level domain name server run and managed by China's Internet Network Information Center processes over 380 million domain name resolution requests every day, with an average of over 4,400 requests processed in one second and a peak value of 8,000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Faced with the fast development of the Internet, China's Internet Network Information Center, China's domain name registration administration, had to reevaluate this year the four original top-level nodes for country code domains across the country and redeployed CN domain top-level nodes based on the results of said reevaluation. </seg>
<seg id=11> Based on local Internet development and software and hardware conditions at access organizations, it was decided to install a top-level node for country code domains in Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id=12> We learn that Shanghai currently has 45,000 CN domain names and 26.6 percent of the population are Internet users. Its Internet penetration rate and application skills are second to none in the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> The East China region surrounding Shanghai, with 130,000 CN domain names and 230,000 websites, is also a leader in terms of development. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Becomes World's Largest Producer of Hard Alloy </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> NANCHANG, December 22, Xinhua (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) The hard alloy industry in China experienced rapid development in recent years, with the annual output exceeding one-third of the global production. In terms of production scale and output, China has become the world's largest hard alloy producer. Offering a complete range of hard alloy types, China can produce most hard alloy products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This is what the reporters learned on the 22nd from China's Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Workshop currently being held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Known as the "industrial tooth," hard alloy is used in cutting tools, high pressure tools, and mechanics of mining and paving engineering for its high rigidity and abrasion resistance. Development of the hard alloy industry is vital to the overall development of the tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It was mentioned that China's hard alloy industry started from scratch in the 1950s, and after continuously development, it now has made remarkable achievements. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s, when the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons, China produced 5,000 tons of hard alloy a year; stepping into the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output is 38,000, while China's hard alloy production per year has soared rapidly to 15,000 tons, or more than one-third of the hard alloy output in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China has also made significant progress in hard alloy export. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's annual hard alloy export was just 100 tons in 1986, and the export volume had reached 2,500 tons by 2003. The export volume is expected to reach more than 3,000 tons this year, which, like the output, also accounts for one-third of the circulation in worldwide hard alloy markets. The foreign currency earned annually through hard alloy export increased from below four million US dollars a year in the past to 70 million US dollars a year nowadays. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> BEIJING, December 23, Xinhua (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) The reporter learned from the Asian Development Bank's China office on the 23rd that the ADB recently approved a loan of 117.4 million US dollars to help build a power plant that will harness the methane produced from coal mining in the southern part of the Shanxi Province. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Coalbed Gas Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technologies to boost the output of coalbed and coalfield gas to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant that will soon be built. </seg>
<seg id=4> Under the project, by the time of its completion in 2008, the project will provide about 90,000 households and industrial and commercial users with at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed gas per year. </seg>
<seg id=5> This will benefit some 410,000 in the Jincheng area. </seg>
<seg id=6> Coal output in Shanxi accounts for about one third of the country's total production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The total cost of the project is estimated at 237 million US dollars, of which a loan of 20 million US dollars will be offered by Japan's Bank for International Cooperation and a loan of 37.86 million US dollars will come from the Industrial Bank of China. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling 61.24 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id=9> The United States Trade and Development Agency also provided a grant of 500,000 US dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane is called coalbed gas when it is obtained from wells built by drilling from the surface into underground coalbeds, and called coalfield gas when the it is produced in underground coal mining operations. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is a highly explosive gas and needs to be drained first in coal mining operations to ensure a safe working environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the alleviation of global warming and climate change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> Substituting methane for coal increases fuel cleanliness, improves coal mine efficiency, and results in cleaner air. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB senior project specialist, said the project was expected to yield a reduction of about 4.5 million tons in carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> JERUSALEM, December 24, (Xinhua) James Snyder, director of the Israel Museum, said on the 24th that the main treasure of the museum, an ivory pomegranate, was confirmed a forgery a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=3> The ivory pomegranate was once considered the only relic discovered to date from the First Temple of Solomon's age. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts found it should be a relic from the Bronze Age, far earlier than the First Temple period of the Jews. </seg>
<seg id=6> A line of text on the pomegranate, in Hebrew, reads: "Belonging to the Temple of Lord Yahweh, a holy thing to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> The inscription was confirmed to have been carved later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Israel Museum bought this ivory pomegranate for 550,000 US dollars from an anonymous collector in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeological and relic experts had believed it was an artifact studded on the top of a scepter for priests of the First Temple, and the only cultural heritage left from that age. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder said that before the ivory pomegranate was purchased, it had been authenticated by Israeli experts including an archaeologist named Nahman Avigad. </seg>
<seg id=11> Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported Avigad examined the artifact recklessly at that time using only a magnifier. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad has personally denied the comment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police successively detected three major cases of fraudulence in cultural relics, summoning several hundred people for interrogation. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> GUANGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) As a major effort to build a "water-saving city," Shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some larger buildings and neighborhoods. At present, relevant codes and regulations for the design of reclaimed water facilities are being formulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" mainly refers to nonpotable water that is for limited use and obtained from treating urban sewage or domestic sewage to a certain a level of water quality. </seg>
<seg id=4> The quality of the water is somewhere between tap water and drained sewage. </seg>
<seg id=5> A large quantity is usually used in toilet flushing, garden and farmland irrigation, road cleaning, car washing, urban fountains, and water refilling for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> An inquiry conducted by the Shenzhen Water Bureau shows Shenzhen once had more than 70 buildings equipped with a "reclaimed water" recycling system in the middle 1990s, but the builders had to give up the utilization as the cost of "reclaimed water" recycling was too high due to factors such as technology, design and management. </seg>
<seg id=7> To have these pipelines play a real role, what needs to be done is to simply invest an additional 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in installing a "reclaimed water" treatment system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If utilized, the over 70 existing "reclaimed water" pipelines can save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen in one single day, based on each neighborhood using 500 tons of "reclaimed water" per day. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=9> It was said that Shenzhen will start its "reclaimed water" recycling by renovating the over 70 buildings that have existing "reclaimed water" systems, and will further expand the project after summing up experience. </seg>
<seg id=10> In the meantime, the Shenzhen municipal water department will work with the urban planning and construction departments to formulate as soon as possible codes for the design of reclaimed water, and prescribe the enforcement of "reclaimed water" use in larger buildings. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The tourists just got on the beach, when the wave began to come in. People mistakenly thought that was the tide, so they didn't pay too much attention. </seg>
<seg id=6> When the tour guide Cai Weiwei found that the tide was coming in strongly, she advised everybody to run as soon as possible to a beachside hotel to avoid the danger. </seg>

<seg id=8> The hotel was three stories high, and the gust of waves swelled to the second floor, so everybody had to stay on the top of the building in bewilderment. It was fortunate that the wave didn't continue to swell. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) The Auctioned Assets of Yugansk Won't be Incorporated into Gazprom </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> MOSCOW, December 30, Xinhua (Reporter Song Shiyi) Medvedev, head of the Russian Presidential Administration and chairman of Gazprom told the media on the 30th that Gazprom will merge with Rosneft as planned in January next year, but the assets of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos Oil Company's biggest subsidiary that Rosneft had purchased, will not be incorporated into the assets of Gazprom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Talking about the reason why assets of the auctioned Yugansk will not be incorporated into Gazprom's assets, Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Khristenko said on the same day that it is primarily because the state is already the principal shareholder of Gazpromneft and has no intention of increasing any shares beyond the controlling shares, reports also said. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said Yugansk's assets will be spun off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the 19th of this month, the Russian Federal Property Fund held an open auction for 76.79 percent of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos Oil Company's biggest subsidiary, and the newly formed BaikalFinansGroup won the bidding at a price of 9.35 billion US dollars. </seg>
<seg id=6> The state-run Rosneft announced on the 22nd that it acquired BaikalFinansGroup, winner of the auction for Yugansk's shares, and became the new holder of Yugansk's equities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Analysts believe the primary reason behind the smart operation by Russia in the auction of Yugansk's assets is to hold a leading position in related legal disputes. </seg>
<seg id=8> Russian President Putin approved Gazprom to merge with Rosneft in September this year. </seg>
<seg id=9> Established in February 1993, Gazprom is the largest natural gas exploitation company in the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> The company holds 65 percent of the natural gas reserves in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=11> The yield from the company last year accounted for 93 percent of the output in Russia and 20% in the world. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Zhang Zhanhai told Xinhua reporters: "one of the most important objectives of this "Dome A" expedition is to make preparations for the third Chinese scientific surveying station that will be built in the Antarctic inland later on, and establish a climate environment monitoring system between the Zhongshan Station and "Dome A." </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Korea Launches Test Operations of Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> SEOUL, January 10, Xinhua (Reporter Zhang Jinfang) The successful test operation of the satellite digital multimedia broadcasting in South Korea on the 10th signaled that South Korea started to enter the satellite digital multimedia broadcasting era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The so-called satellite digital multimedia broadcasting means that the audience can use terminals like mobile phones to receive program signals or move through satellite-broadcasted multimedia radio and TV channels. </seg>
<seg id=4> On the morning of the 10th when the satellite digital multimedia broadcasting was launched, TU Media, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, initiated 9 channels in total, covering 3 TV channels, such as news, music and TV series, and 6 music channels, such as latest popular songs, classic songs, and Jazz music. </seg>
<seg id=5> On the same day, SK Telecom released the first 250 handsets that can receive satellite digital multimedia broadcasting into the market. With these handsets, part of the audience received satellite digital multimedia programs in broadcasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> It was said that the South Korean government had listed satellite digital multimedia broadcasting as a key scientific project, and aggressively supports enterprises to develop satellite digital multimedia broadcasting technologies and products. </seg>
<seg id=7> In April 2004, the Parliament of South Korea passed the newly revised "Broadcasting Law" to permit satellite digital multimedia broadcasting. </seg>
<seg id=8> At the end of 2003, South Korean SK Telecom and Japanese businesses jointly founded TU media for the preparation work of satellite digital multimedia broadcasting stations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Afterwards, businesses, such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, succeeded in the development of handsets that can receive satellite digital multimedia broadcasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In South Korea, relevant authorities have decided that satellite digital multimedia broadcasting needs to go through a four-month trial first and will begin commercial services after this May. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Research Institution Forecast: Hong Kong's Economy to Grow at Around 6 percent in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> HONG KONG, January 11, Xinhua (Reporter Su Xiao) The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that the global economic environment remains favorable this year, and that Hong Kong's economy is expected to develop at around 6 percent with an annualized 4.4 percent growth in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU, pointed out in the press conference of the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" that although interest rates are expected to be hiked this year, the economic growths of Hong Kong's major trade partners keep sluggish, and the economic growths of the United States and the Mainland China are respectively 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent, the global economic environment remains promising in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that according to the forecast of the center, the economic growth of Hong Kong will remain at around 6 percent in 2005, but consumer prices will increase by 3 percent at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Job market adjustment remains sluggish with the unemployment rate declining slightly to around 6.3 percent by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Uncertainties caused by the fluctuations of the global oil price are still the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Study Center, said that the economic growth momentum in the first quarter of this year will turn moderate, and GDP will grow at 4.4 percent. The slowdown reflects a gradual weakening in Hong Kong's demand for foreign goods, as the economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners tends to be even slower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, the real GDP of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a robust growth of 8 percent with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5 percent, as deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast at HKU, remarked that Hong Kong's economy in 2004 showed a strong growth, and that reflects mainly the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The external sector is very competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the rapid development of the market economy in mainland China last year. The ending of deflation will enable business owners to enjoy stronger cash flows. </seg>
