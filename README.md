## Basic Requirement

Our source is based on the <a href="https://github.com/lisa-groundhog/GroundHog">GroundHog</a>. Before use our code, please install it.

## How to Run?

To train a good VNMT model, you need follow two steps.

###  Step 1. Pretraining

Pretrain a base model using the GroundHog.

### Step 2. Retraining

Go to the `work` directory, and put the pretrained model to this directory, i.e. use the pretrained model to initialize the parameters of VNMT.

Simply Run (Clearly, before that you need re-config the `chinese.py` file to your own dataset :))
```
run.sh
```
That's it!

*Notice that our test and deveopment set is the NIST dataset, which follow the `sgm` format! Please see the `work/data/dev` for example.*
